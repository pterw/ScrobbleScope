---

Purpose:
- Improve input validation UX and reduce impossible queries.

Backend tasks:
- Extend `/validate_user` response with `registered_year` when available.
- Use Last.fm `user.getinfo.registered.unixtime`.
- Add server-side guard for submitted `year < registered_year` with clear error.

Frontend tasks:
- On successful username validation:
  - Set `#year.min` to `registered_year`.
  - Show inline guidance text.
- If user enters lower year:
  - Show inline validation error.
  - Block submission or rely on native validity + custom message.

Acceptance:
- For `flounder14`, min year resolves to 2016.
- Inline and server-side validation both enforce constraints.
