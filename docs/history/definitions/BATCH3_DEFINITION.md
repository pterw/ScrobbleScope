# Batch 3: Remove nested thread pattern

Status: **Complete**

---

Purpose:
- Eliminate unnecessary thread layering and event-loop confusion risk.

Current anti-pattern:
- `results_loading` starts a thread that calls `background_task`.
- `background_task` calls `run_async_in_thread`.

Target:
- Single background thread runs async coroutine directly once.

Implementation options:
1. Keep thread in `results_loading`, convert `background_task` to run sync wrapper that owns loop directly (no second thread).
2. Or remove outer thread and keep `run_async_in_thread` (less preferred for request lifecycle).

Acceptance:
- No nested thread creation.
- No AsyncLimiter loop warnings.
- Same user-visible behavior.
