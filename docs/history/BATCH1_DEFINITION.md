# Batch 1: Proper upstream failure state + retry UX

Status: **Complete**
Archived from `PLAYBOOK.md` Section 4 on 2026-02-22.

Purpose:
- Distinguish "no data" from "upstream unavailable".

Backend tasks:
- Introduce typed upstream failure classification:
  - `lastfm_upstream_unavailable`
  - `spotify_upstream_unavailable`
  - `user_not_found`
  - `rate_limited`
- Update progress payload to include structured error metadata:
  - `error_code`
  - `source`
  - `retryable`
  - `retry_after` (when known)
- Ensure Last.fm 5xx exhaustion does NOT map to "No albums found."

Frontend tasks:
- Loading page failure panel with explicit CTAs:
  - `Retry now` for retryable failures.
  - `Back home` fallback.
- Preserve existing reset behavior but align messaging to error type.

Acceptance:
- Last.fm repeated 5xx produces explicit upstream-failure message.
- "No albums found" only for legitimate empty-result conditions.
- Retry action works when failure is retryable.
