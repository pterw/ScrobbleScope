# ScrobbleScope Execution Playbook

Date: 2026-02-22
Purpose: Single source of truth for work sequencing and execution history.
Rules for agent behaviour live in `AGENTS.md`; current-state snapshot in
`.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. Why this document exists

- Provide a single source of truth for work sequencing.
- Enable continuation by another agent with minimal context loss.
- Prevent risky refactor-first changes before parity tests exist.

**Implementation principles:**
1. Approval tests before structural refactor.
2. No behavior-breaking refactors without parity checks.
3. Add observability before optimization where possible.
4. Keep changes batch-scoped and reversible.
5. Keep security-safe rendering (`tojson`, escaping) as baseline.

## 2. Batch order (strict sequence)

Completed batch definitions are archived individually under `docs/history/`.

A batch's close-out entry sits in its per-batch log only when the heading
carried a `(Batch N WP-X)` tag (as Batch 18's did). Close-outs tagged
`(Batch N close-out)` are not parser-recognized and were routed to the
monolith archive instead -- Batches 19 and 20 are the current examples.
See FINDINGS F-DOCSYNC-3.

### Open decisions (owner confirmation needed)

1. Persistent store choice: Postgres only or Postgres + Redis.
2. Retry UX policy: immediate retry button only, or retry + cooldown messaging.
3. Error copy style and user-facing tone for upstream failures.

## 3. Active batch + next action

- **UI audit Minors side task (owner, 2026-10-30):** branch
  `fix/ui-audit-minors`, cut from `main` at `18a4242d`. It bundles the minor
  findings that the 2026-10-27 UI audit's reviews deferred into one bug-fix
  PR: collect them, check each against current `main`, triage each row with
  the owner (fix, defer with a finding id, or drop), then plan and land the
  accepted fixes. The streamgraph smoothing defect that headed the list
  (negative band thickness beside a one-week spike) is already fixed on
  `main` by PR #280's `streamSafeSegments`, with a curve-sampling test. The
  owner also asked for the streamgraph's bottom month labels to match the
  heatmap's month labels in typeface and size. The owner accepted the triage
  on 2026-10-30. The spec is
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-31-ui-audit-minors-design.md` and the plan
  is `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-31-ui-audit-minors.md`; four of its
  visual tasks land only after the owner sees before-and-after screenshots.

- **Weekly chart geometry side task:** Complete and merged as PR #281, merge
  commit `18a4242d`. The execution record is
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-30-weekly-chart-geometry.md`.

- **Listening view side task:** Complete and merged as PR #280, merge commit
  `c1ca5f18`. Independent F-SWE-8 work stays gated. The execution record is
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-28-streamgraph-context-halo.md`.

- **Batch 23 is active.** Definition: `BATCH23_DEFINITION.md`.
  Branch: `feat/batch23-wp0-hygiene`. That branch merged into `main` as PR #245 on 2026-09-30 and `origin/test` is
  deleted, so side-task PRs branch from `main` and run the guard against its default
  base. The owner names the branch WP-1 opens.
- **Next action:** WP-0 is next.
  Part A and Part B are complete. Part C continues through the three
  follow-on plans in the order recorded under "After this plan" in
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-23-batch23-wp0-reconcile-and-clear.md`:
  control-plane, frontend, then test infrastructure and dependencies.
  The control-plane plan is written and reviewed:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-25-batch23-wp0-control-plane.md`. Its eight
  tasks are all complete (Task 7 landed `8cf5fd4`..`c39da3c`). The frontend
  and test-infrastructure/dependencies plans are now written and reviewed:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-26-batch23-wp0-frontend.md` and
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-26-batch23-wp0-test-infra-deps.md`. The
  frontend plan and the test-infrastructure/dependencies plan are both fully
  executed (every task in each has landed). The three plans' carried items
  are closed out, and their final code review of the whole branch ran on
  2026-09-27; its one fix wave has landed and passed a scoped re-review
  (see Section 4). The WP-0 close-out below is what remains of WP-0. The
  definition owns WP-0 scope and acceptance; `docs/agents/FINDINGS.md`
  owns open finding status.
- **WP-0 close-out:** Re-review `e7e076b` independently, review the whole
  branch, verify Part C's listed findings member by member, and run the
  final gates in the definition. Then write one tagged `(Batch 23 WP-0)`
  Section 4 entry, carrying an explicit `**Status:** WP-0 complete` line
  (DOC007 requires it before the package reads done). Earlier WP-0 commits
  remain untagged by the owner's 2026-09-23 ruling in the definition. It runs
  after the tranche, before WP-1 (owner ruling 2026-10-22).
- **Before WP-1: a tranche of side-task PRs** (owner rulings 2026-10-20).
  Each is its own branch off `main` and its own PR, with atomic commits:
  the include-unmatched control, a documentation refresh (README,
  architecture diagrams), backend hygiene, UI consistency, and four of the
  architecture seams the 2026-09-30 review proposed -- the album request
  module, one album-metadata encoding, the statistics module, and
  normalized Last.fm scrobbles with one album aggregate. The include-unmatched
  control (PR #1) and backend hygiene (PR #2) are done. The album request module
  is done (PR #3, branch refactor/album-request-module, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-album-request-module.md`); normalized
  Last.fm scrobbles with one album aggregate is done (PR #4, branch
  refactor/lastfm-scrobbles, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-lastfm-scrobbles.md`); one album-metadata
  encoding is done (PR #5, branch refactor/metadata-encoding, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-metadata-encoding.md`); the statistics
  module is done (PR #6, branch refactor/statistics-module, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-statistics-module.md`). Job persistence
  waits: a database-backed job store would keep the database awake, which
  the hosting cost ceiling does not allow. The design is
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-20-pre-batch23-tranche-design.md` and the
  order is `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-pre-batch23-tranche.md`.
  PR #7, UI consistency, finished round 1 (plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-ui-consistency-round-1.md`); further rounds
  wait for the owner's screenshots, each with its own plan. A side-task PR of
  cheap fixes from the 2026-10-21 architecture review and the logging audit
  is done (branch `fix/pre-batch23-side-tasks`, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-22-pre-batch23-side-tasks.md`), and so is a
  CI change that keeps Playwright's Ubuntu packages in the Actions cache
  (branch `ci/playwright-apt-cache`, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-22-ci-playwright-apt-cache.md`). UI
  consistency round 2 is done (PR #268, branch `feat/ui-consistency-round-2`,
  plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-23-ui-consistency-round-2.md`). Its
  backlog runs now on `feat/ui-round-2-backlog`: the owner settles each item
  in a live session and the accepted changes landed as they were made (PR
  #269). All fourteen tasks of the plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-25-ui-round-2-backlog.md` have landed on
  the same branch (the documentation, the gates that hold the accepted
  changes, the F-B23-46 ranking rule and the stale-copy sweep), followed by a
  test consolidation under the owner's lean-suite ruling. PR #269 merged
  into `main` (merge commit `997f7584`) and is deployed. The album-matching,
  cache re-verification and MusicBrainz fixes are on `fix/album-matching`
  (PR #270, plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-25-album-matching.md`),
  based on `main`: every plan task has landed there and the six findings it
  files are closed. PR #270 merged into `main` (merge commit `4a2d2406`) and is deployed. The documentation refresh merges last.
- **Batch 23 close-out obligation:** WP-7 includes the deferred Batch 21
  frontend and accessibility audit; the batch cannot close without it.
- **What PR #245 ships (owner ruling 2026-09-29):** the WP-0 foundation and
  every fix from the three reviews, including the job module with its storage
  seam, typed provider failures and provider failure logs that carry no
  listener data. Moved to the follow-up PR: job persistence, the Last.fm
  scrobble seams, the album request module, one album-metadata encoding, the
  statistics module and the tooling package.
- **Architecture seams before the Spotify import (owner ruling 2026-09-29):**
  "If any seams from architechture deepening are worth doing now before
  further feeat implements, thats the time." The seams and the work package
  each one gates are in
  `docs/history/reports/architecture-review-20260930-0040.html`: a job
  module with a storage seam and typed provider failures, job persistence
  (gates WP-3), an album request module (gates WP-4), normalized Last.fm
  scrobbles with one typed album aggregate (gates WP-2), one album-metadata
  encoding (gates WP-3), a statistics module (gates WP-6), and provider
  failure logs that carry no listener data. Which of these #245 ships is
  in the "What PR #245 ships" bullet above; the rest wait for the follow-up
  PR.

## 4. Execution log (for agent handoff)

Keep only the active window here: current batch entries plus the latest 4
non-current operational logs. Older dated entries live in
`docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.

**How to read dated entries:**
- Each heading `YYYY-MM-DD - ...` is a completion/addendum log.
- Untagged side-task history: `docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Tagged batch history: per-batch logs under `docs/history/logs/`.
- Batch scope/acceptance criteria: definitions under `docs/history/definitions/`.
- Current-batch boundaries are machine-managed (do not move entries manually):
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->`
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->

### 2026-10-31 - Clear the stored pause choice on every exit

The spotlight photo gate's paused-hold probe stores `ss-motion=still`
through an init script, and only the Play click removed it, so an early
return left the choice in the shared browser context. The probe's `finally`
now removes the `ss-motion` key before it closes the page. The removal is
wrapped in `contextlib.suppress(PlaywrightError)` (shorter than tracking
navigation state), so a page that never navigated cannot hide the original
failure. This closes audit row 40 of the UI audit Minors. No deviations.
Existing tests edited: none (one test added,
`test_an_early_return_leaves_no_stored_pause_choice`).

Validation: `pytest -q` -- **3111 passed**.

### 2026-10-30 - Report an empty stream and always run its cleanup

The stream gate's paint check called `min()` on the contrast ratios before
reporting a stream with no drawn layers, so an empty stream raised a
ValueError instead of the named failure. The contrast line is now skipped
when there are no ratios, and the failure "the stream draws no artist
layers" is returned. The keyboard check's cleanup ran its three steps in
sequence, so a raising first step skipped the viewport restore and the job
delete; each step now runs in a nested `finally` and the first error still
surfaces. This closes audit rows 23 and 30 of the UI audit Minors. No
deviations. Existing tests edited: none.

Validation: `pytest -q` -- **3109 passed**.

### 2026-10-30 - Keep a numeric font weight after `normal` in the gate

The frontend gate's canvas font parser read `600 normal 26px x` as weight
400, because the `normal` token reset the weight set just before it. The
saved-image headline check could then report a wrong drawn weight. `normal`
is no longer treated as a weight token, so a numeric weight stands, `bold`
still maps to 700 and a string with no weight stays 400. This closes audit
row 3 of the UI audit Minors. No deviations. Existing test edited:
`test_a_saved_headline_drawn_at_another_weight_is_reported` (one case
added, `600 normal 18px x`).

Validation: `pytest -q` -- **3109 passed**.

### 2026-10-30 - Plan the UI audit Minors bug fixes

The deferred Minors from the 2026-10-27 UI audit's reviews were checked
against `main` by a read-only audit. Of 79 rows, 43 were still true, and the
owner accepted a triage of them on 2026-10-30. The spec records each chosen
row with its evidence and lists the deferred and dropped rows. The plan
slices the fixes into eleven atomic tasks: stream panel keyboard and
screen-reader behaviour, gate-helper fixes, two CSS tidy-ups, and four
visual changes that land only after the owner previews them (panel header
size, key spacing, month labels, vertical centring). One plan review found
two Important issues: a focus rule that also caught pointer focus, and a
false claim about the saved image. Both were fixed with its eight Minors
before this commit. Docs only.

Validation: the full suite measured **3108 passed**; pre-commit on all
files and the final docsync check pass.
