# ScrobbleScope Execution Playbook

Date: 2026-02-22
Purpose: Single source of truth for work sequencing and execution history.
Rules for agent behaviour live in `AGENTS.md`; current-state snapshot in
`.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. Why this document exists

- Provide a single source of truth for work sequencing.
- Enable continuation by another agent with minimal context loss.
- Prevent risky refactor-first changes before parity tests exist.

**Implementation principles:**
1. Approval tests before structural refactor.
2. No behavior-breaking refactors without parity checks.
3. Add observability before optimization where possible.
4. Keep changes batch-scoped and reversible.
5. Keep security-safe rendering (`tojson`, escaping) as baseline.

## 2. Batch order (strict sequence)

Completed batch definitions are archived individually under `docs/history/`.

### Batch index (completed batches archived; the active batch, if any, is listed last)

A batch's close-out entry sits in its per-batch log only when the heading
carried a `(Batch N WP-X)` tag (as Batch 18's did). Close-outs tagged
`(Batch N close-out)` are not parser-recognized and were routed to the
monolith archive instead -- Batches 19 and 20 are the current examples.
See FINDINGS F-DOCSYNC-3.

### Open decisions (owner confirmation needed)

1. Persistent store choice: Postgres only or Postgres + Redis.
2. Retry UX policy: immediate retry button only, or retry + cooldown messaging.
3. Error copy style and user-facing tone for upstream failures.

## 3. Active batch + next action

- **Batch 23 is active.** Definition: `BATCH23_DEFINITION.md`.
  Branch: `feat/batch23-wp0-hygiene`. That branch merged into `main` as PR #245 on 2026-09-30 and `origin/test` is
  deleted, so side-task PRs branch from `main` and run the guard against its default
  base. The owner names the branch WP-1 opens.
- **Next action:** WP-0 is next.
  Part A and Part B are complete. Part C continues through the three
  follow-on plans in the order recorded under "After this plan" in
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-23-batch23-wp0-reconcile-and-clear.md`:
  control-plane, frontend, then test infrastructure and dependencies.
  The control-plane plan is written and reviewed:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-25-batch23-wp0-control-plane.md`. Its eight
  tasks are all complete (Task 7 landed `8cf5fd4`..`c39da3c`). The frontend
  and test-infrastructure/dependencies plans are now written and reviewed:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-26-batch23-wp0-frontend.md` and
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-26-batch23-wp0-test-infra-deps.md`. The
  frontend plan and the test-infrastructure/dependencies plan are both fully
  executed (every task in each has landed). The three plans' carried items
  are closed out, and their final code review of the whole branch ran on
  2026-09-27; its one fix wave has landed and passed a scoped re-review
  (see Section 4). The WP-0 close-out below is what remains of WP-0. The
  definition owns WP-0 scope and acceptance; `docs/agents/FINDINGS.md`
  owns open finding status.
- **WP-0 close-out:** Re-review `e7e076b` independently, review the whole
  branch, verify Part C's listed findings member by member, and run the
  final gates in the definition. Then write one tagged `(Batch 23 WP-0)`
  Section 4 entry, carrying an explicit `**Status:** WP-0 complete` line
  (DOC007 requires it before the package reads done). Earlier WP-0 commits
  remain untagged by the owner's 2026-09-23 ruling in the definition. It runs
  after the tranche, before WP-1 (owner ruling 2026-10-22).
- **Before WP-1: a tranche of side-task PRs** (owner rulings 2026-10-20).
  Each is its own branch off `main` and its own PR, with atomic commits:
  the include-unmatched control, a documentation refresh (README,
  architecture diagrams), backend hygiene, UI consistency, and four of the
  architecture seams the 2026-09-30 review proposed -- the album request
  module, one album-metadata encoding, the statistics module, and
  normalized Last.fm scrobbles with one album aggregate. The include-unmatched
  control (PR #1) and backend hygiene (PR #2) are done. The album request module
  is done (PR #3, branch refactor/album-request-module, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-album-request-module.md`); normalized
  Last.fm scrobbles with one album aggregate is done (PR #4, branch
  refactor/lastfm-scrobbles, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-lastfm-scrobbles.md`); one album-metadata
  encoding is done (PR #5, branch refactor/metadata-encoding, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-metadata-encoding.md`); the statistics
  module is done (PR #6, branch refactor/statistics-module, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-statistics-module.md`). Job persistence
  waits: a database-backed job store would keep the database awake, which
  the hosting cost ceiling does not allow. The design is
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-20-pre-batch23-tranche-design.md` and the
  order is `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-pre-batch23-tranche.md`.
  PR #7, UI consistency, finished round 1 (plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-ui-consistency-round-1.md`); further rounds
  wait for the owner's screenshots, each with its own plan. A side-task PR of
  cheap fixes from the 2026-10-21 architecture review and the logging audit
  is done (branch `fix/pre-batch23-side-tasks`, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-22-pre-batch23-side-tasks.md`), and so is a
  CI change that keeps Playwright's Ubuntu packages in the Actions cache
  (branch `ci/playwright-apt-cache`, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-22-ci-playwright-apt-cache.md`). UI
  consistency round 2 is done (PR #268, branch `feat/ui-consistency-round-2`,
  plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-23-ui-consistency-round-2.md`). Its
  backlog runs now on `feat/ui-round-2-backlog`: the owner settles each item
  in a live session and the accepted changes landed as they were made (PR
  #269). All fourteen tasks of the plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-25-ui-round-2-backlog.md` have landed on
  the same branch (the documentation, the gates that hold the accepted
  changes, the F-B23-46 ranking rule and the stale-copy sweep), followed by a
  test consolidation under the owner's lean-suite ruling. PR #269 merged
  into `main` (merge commit `997f7584`) and is deployed. The album-matching,
  cache re-verification and MusicBrainz fixes are on `fix/album-matching`
  (PR #270, plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-25-album-matching.md`),
  based on `main`: every plan task has landed there and the six findings it
  files are closed. PR #270 merged into `main` (merge commit `4a2d2406`) and is deployed. The documentation refresh merges last.
- **Batch 23 close-out obligation:** WP-7 includes the deferred Batch 21
  frontend and accessibility audit; the batch cannot close without it.
- **What PR #245 ships (owner ruling 2026-09-29):** the WP-0 foundation and
  every fix from the three reviews, including the job module with its storage
  seam, typed provider failures and provider failure logs that carry no
  listener data. Moved to the follow-up PR: job persistence, the Last.fm
  scrobble seams, the album request module, one album-metadata encoding, the
  statistics module and the tooling package.
- **Architecture seams before the Spotify import (owner ruling 2026-09-29):**
  "If any seams from architechture deepening are worth doing now before
  further feeat implements, thats the time." The seams and the work package
  each one gates are in
  `docs/history/reports/architecture-review-20260930-0040.html`: a job
  module with a storage seam and typed provider failures, job persistence
  (gates WP-3), an album request module (gates WP-4), normalized Last.fm
  scrobbles with one typed album aggregate (gates WP-2), one album-metadata
  encoding (gates WP-3), a statistics module (gates WP-6), and provider
  failure logs that carry no listener data. Which of these #245 ships is
  in the "What PR #245 ships" bullet above; the rest wait for the follow-up
  PR.

## 4. Execution log (for agent handoff)

Keep only the active window here: current batch entries plus the latest 4
non-current operational logs. Older dated entries live in
`docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.

**How to read dated entries:**
- Each heading `YYYY-MM-DD - ...` is a completion/addendum log.
- Untagged side-task history: `docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Tagged batch history: per-batch logs under `docs/history/logs/`.
- Batch scope/acceptance criteria: definitions under `docs/history/definitions/`.
- Current-batch boundaries are machine-managed (do not move entries manually):
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->`
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->

### 2026-10-28 - Add the streamgraph context halo

Side task on `feat/streamgraph-bursts`. The owner replaced the earlier
artist-only follow-up with the context-halo direction and approved its T0
plan. Partial implementation started before that approval; it was paused,
disclosed, and reviewed against the approved plan before continuing.

Keep the ten featured artists' stack independent of the residual. Draw the
remaining plays as a default-on symmetric halo at one quarter thickness,
with a visibility control that preserves artist paths, counts and scale.
Reuse heatmap month positions on the lower axis, add circular tooltip markers
and a residual divider, and use ten deterministic candidate-derived colours.
A final partial-week label is anchored inward to avoid clipping without
moving its calendar gridline. Save Image keeps the selected halo state.

Superseded burst and hidden-contributor test cases were replaced or removed;
focused coverage checks geometry, empty and spike weeks, interaction, axis
alignment and exposed halo pixels in both export states. The previous suite
had 3116 tests; the fresh suite measured **3113 passed** in three shards.
Focused Chromium and Firefox checks pass after the final-week fix. Four
matched real-data captures and the colour audit are recorded in the context
plan. The final-state browser gate passed 58 checks in 89 runs across
Chromium and Firefox. All pre-commit hooks and the final docsync check pass.
The alignment hook reports the known advisory WT003 side-task branch warning.

### 2026-10-28 - Integrate main before final streamgraph validation

Side task, no batch tag: normal merge of origin/main at f94c490f into
`feat/streamgraph-bursts`, after Task 9 while the owner layout choice waits.
The plan had integration after Task 10; advancing this independent work is
an order deviation, not a scope addition or history rewrite. Main brings
PR #279's Deezer 403 handling, MusicBrainz spacing and operations record.
No stream UI source changes are included in this merge.

Five conflicts concern counts and dated documentation histories. Preserve
both parents' log entries, retain Section 3 unchanged, then refresh the
managed counts from a fresh run. Independent pre-rotation review proved
658 HEAD and 653 main dated entries preserved exactly across PLAYBOOK and
archive, and main's automatic source/test merges match its parent. Docsync
performs the rotation; no log entry is discarded or moved across markers
by hand. Fresh suite shards: 702 + 1509 + 905. Existing test changes are
upstream provider/config cases, unchanged from main.

Forward guidance: Task 10 UI/gate patches stay in isolated worktrees.
The real-data top-ten preview preserves all 53 weekly totals, shows no
contributors and passes both-theme numeric-row checks. Its short-window
page sizing remains pending the owner's KPI/bottom-spacing choice. Run
integrated frontend and results-behavior checks after that final UI patch;
this merge makes no final browser or prototype-approval claim. No PR/push.

Validation: `pytest -q` -- **3116 passed**.

### 2026-10-28 - Return weekly artists to the top ten

Side task, no batch tag: Task 9 on `feat/streamgraph-bursts`. The owner
requested top ten only and no residual contributor list after live testing.
Reverse this branch's own burst selection and contributor metadata in plays,
job readback and their tests. The four files match origin/main exactly;
none changed upstream since the original branch base. Original normalized
ranking/ties, Monday columns, window filtering, empty-key residuals and
nested-copy isolation coverage remain. README and the sequence diagram
again describe top ten. No UI source changes in this checkpoint.

Plan vs implementation: exact scoped reversal, no history rewrite. Tests
solely for the removed feature are removed; original behavior tests return.
Focused plays/jobs/heatmap: 114 passed. Independent spec/quality review
approved. Fresh full shards: 702 + 1507 + 905. No browser gate is triggered
by these backend-only paths; Task 10 runs the integrated UI gate.

Forward guidance: Task 10 removes remaining contributor UI and unused
styles, caps the client at ten and reduces the chart box. Measured short
viewports cannot fit the original gaps and 268px tooltip together. Owner
choice on compact KPI/bottom spacing is pending; page-scroll assertions
remain strict. Final main integration, live approval and PR remain pending.
Section 3 batch sequencing is unchanged. WT003/WT005/WT010/WT012 are
advisory under the owner's instruction; no lineage repair is attempted.

Validation: `pytest -q` -- **3114 passed**.

### 2026-10-28 - Keep residual counts outside the artist stream

Side task, no batch tag: Task 8 checkpoint on `feat/streamgraph-bursts`.
Only named artist counts feed SVG baseline, fit, stack and hit mapping.
Everything else stays numeric, normal-weight and without a painted swatch;
keyboard selection leaves artist paths undimmed. Residual-only weeks and
payloads remain scrubbable; all-zero data draws no stream. Original rocket
arrays and permutation remain. Four unused residual colour tokens are removed.
README, DESIGN and the original plan/spec distinguish named-only geometry
from full weekly totals. No payload or server changes in this checkpoint.

Existing pure hit-test cases were extended for direct slot/rank mapping,
empty bands, boundaries, empty stack and residual-only weeks. Red: 6 failed,
4 passed; green: 10 passed; whole file: 150 passed. Existing browser families
now check named paths, numeric residual style/count, undimmed keyboard state,
residual-only/all-zero jobs and named JPEG pixels. A metamorphic assertion
proves 10,000x residual volume leaves artist geometry unchanged. Independent
source/runtime review approved. Full locked gate: 58 checks in 89 runs across
Chromium/Firefox. Fresh suite shards: 702 + 1507 + 912. Real-data Firefox
captures pass data/geometry in both themes; the agent did not judge visuals.

Deviations/forward guidance: the owner liked the artist-only preview, then
requested removal of contributor rows, a smaller SVG box without vertical
scrolling and a return to top ten only. This commit preserves Task 8's
reviewed twelve-artist checkpoint; newly defined Tasks 9-10 supersede its
retained contributor block and height reservation before final publication.
Code phases may run in parallel; land backend Task 9 before UI Task 10.
Final owner approval, main integration and PR publication remain pending.
Section 3 batch sequencing is unchanged. No history rewrite.

Validation: `pytest -q` -- **3121 passed**.
