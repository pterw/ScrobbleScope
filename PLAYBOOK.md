# ScrobbleScope Execution Playbook

Date: 2026-02-22
Purpose: Single source of truth for work sequencing and execution history.
Rules for agent behaviour live in `AGENTS.md`; current-state snapshot in
`.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. Why this document exists

- Provide a single source of truth for work sequencing.
- Enable continuation by another agent with minimal context loss.
- Prevent risky refactor-first changes before parity tests exist.

**Implementation principles:**
1. Approval tests before structural refactor.
2. No behavior-breaking refactors without parity checks.
3. Add observability before optimization where possible.
4. Keep changes batch-scoped and reversible.
5. Keep security-safe rendering (`tojson`, escaping) as baseline.

## 2. Batch order (strict sequence)

Completed batch definitions are archived individually under `docs/history/`.

A batch's close-out entry sits in its per-batch log only when the heading
carried a `(Batch N WP-X)` tag (as Batch 18's did). Close-outs tagged
`(Batch N close-out)` are not parser-recognized and were routed to the
monolith archive instead -- Batches 19 and 20 are the current examples.
See FINDINGS F-DOCSYNC-3.

### Open decisions (owner confirmation needed)

1. Persistent store choice: Postgres only or Postgres + Redis.
2. Retry UX policy: immediate retry button only, or retry + cooldown messaging.
3. Error copy style and user-facing tone for upstream failures.

## 3. Active batch + next action

- **Batch 18 is complete.** All 5 WPs done. Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH18_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 19 is complete.** All 5 WPs done plus owner-review follow-up.
  Definition archived: `docs/history/definitions/BATCH19_DEFINITION.md`.
  PR #152 (Batches 18 + 19) merged to `main`.
- **Batch 20 is complete.** All 9 WPs done (WP-0 through WP-5 via PR #159
  on `file-hygeine`; audit gap-fix follow-up, WP-6, WP-7, and WP-8 on
  `wip/batch-20`, submitted as PR #162). Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH20_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 21 is active.** Definition: `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` (repo
  root). Scope: UI overhaul -- Bootstrap 5.1.3 -> Tailwind v4 (standalone
  CLI) + daisyUI v5, warm heatmap-derived themes propagated app-wide,
  page-by-page strangler migration. Expanded from the owner's Claude
  Design audit (UI Audit v3); four owner decisions locked in the
  definition. Branch: `wip/batch-21` (worktree off `main`).
- **Next action:** WP-2 is complete and **submitted as PR #216**, pushed
  2026-08-23. It shipped the base shell, the `error.html` pilot, the
  Playwright runtime, the frontend gate, and the compiled-CSS pre-commit
  hook, closing F-B21-2, F-B21-7 and F-AUDIT-1 and filing F-B21-10, F-B21-11
  and F-B21-12. The Quality Gate passed on `45fbbe8`: 12 steps green in
  1m40s, `pytest` 666 passed, `frontend_gate` 4 checks passed, and the Linux
  digest `71402508a5775dcb...` matched the Windows build. `pip-audit` still
  reports its advisories without failing the gate, by design (F-B21-3).
  Three review rounds are applied on top: seven Codex comments in all,
  every one valid and fixed. Round three took the SMIL out of the header
  wordmark and gave the back-to-top control its wrapper back. The suite
  is 713 and the gate runs 5 checks now.
  **WP-3 is next**: the index page, which deletes the welcome modal, replaces
  `bootstrap.Popover` with CSS-only hints, and relocates `limit_results` into
  the thresholds disclosure. The root-hygiene side task is
  **closed**: the owner rejected the audience-banner scheme on 2026-08-20,
  and the config-file verdict landed in `DEPLOY.md`.
  Earlier context, still true: **PR #171 merged to `main` on 2026-08-19**
  (`bb187ae`, rebase merge) with zero unresolved review threads after eight
  rounds; `wip/batch-21` was realigned to it. `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` was
  amended the same day so the batch gate can fail on frontend work.
  PR #169 merged 2026-08-08 shipping the
  repository-integrity gate and read-only worktree guard, resolving
  F-DOCSYNC-5/F-WORKTREE-1/F-WORKTREE-2; three guard files exceed their
  directory peer caps, accepted as a deviation and tracked as F-WORKTREE-4,
  not silently. PR #170 merged 2026-08-12 (`5b060a2`), settling the guard and
  docsync sources the audit reads.
- Batch 21 WP status: WP-0, WP-1 and WP-2 done. WP-3 through WP-8 not yet
  started.
- **Perf note:** heatmap fetch speed is rate-limit bound; measurement and
  rationale live in FINDINGS.md F-B18-11 (single source).
- **Last.timer note (checked 2026-05-19):** the referenced project uses
  aggregate `user.gettopartists`/`user.gettoptracks` calls with page fan-out,
  not exact per-scrobble recent-track timestamps. Useful for future perf
  research, but not a drop-in heatmap speedup. See FINDINGS.md F-B19-3.
- Future feature candidates (confirmed by owner roadmap):
  - **Top songs** (future): rank most-played tracks for a year (Last.fm + possibly
    Spotify enrichment, separate background task + loading/results flow).

## 4. Execution log (for agent handoff)

Keep only the active window here: current batch entries plus the latest 4
non-current operational logs. Older dated entries live in
`docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.

**How to read dated entries:**
- Each heading `YYYY-MM-DD - ...` is a completion/addendum log.
- Untagged side-task history: `docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Tagged batch history: per-batch logs under `docs/history/logs/`.
- Batch scope/acceptance criteria: definitions under `docs/history/definitions/`.
- Current-batch boundaries are machine-managed (do not move entries manually):
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->`
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->`
- After any edit here, run `python scripts/doc_state_sync.py --fix`.
- Archive search: `rg -n "^### 20" docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->

### 2026-07-24 - Batch 21 opened: UI overhaul definition committed (Batch 21 WP-0)

- Scope: opened Batch 21 (UI overhaul -- Tailwind + daisyUI migration)
  on `wip/batch-21`, a worktree off `main` at the PR #162 merge.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` expanded from the stub into the full 9-WP
    definition derived from the owner's Claude Design audit (UI Audit
    v3): toolchain (WP-1), base shell + error-page pilot (WP-2), index
    (WP-3), unified loading (WP-4), results leaderboard (WP-5), heatmap
    seam removal (WP-6), unmatched + reason_code backend fix (WP-7),
    sweep + close-out (WP-8). Strangler migration, page by page.
  - Four owner decisions locked in the definition: rotating loading
    messages cut; welcome modal deleted; `limit_results` kept inside the
    thresholds disclosure; fonts self-hosted under `static/fonts/`.
  - Agent verification recorded in the definition: the unmatched
    reason-string grouping bug is live; `--bs-primary` never overridden;
    `bootstrap.Popover` in `index.js` is a third Bootstrap JS consumer
    the audit missed; `--bars-color` must be aliased in both themes.
  - PLAYBOOK Section 2 row title updated; Section 3 marks Batch 21
    active with next action WP-1; SESSION_CONTEXT rows updated.
  - Toolchain mechanics locked after an owner-relayed Opus 5 review:
    CLI binary in gitignored `scripts/bin/` with `.gitkeep`; auto-fetch
    at a pinned version via a new `scripts/dev/tailwind_build.py` (not
    `dev_start.py` -- app startup never needs the toolchain); WP-8 adds
    a rebuild-and-diff pre-commit hook for compiled-CSS drift; WP-8
    owner E2E explicitly opens the downloaded save-as-image file.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0 (expected
  root warning for the now-active `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md`).
- Forward guidance: WP-1 sets up the Tailwind v4 standalone CLI +
  daisyUI v5 bundled plugin, defines both themes from the audit token
  sheet, and commits the compiled CSS. No template changes until WP-2.

### 2026-08-20 - F-SWE-2 UTC album-year window fixed (Batch 21 WP-0)

- Scope: cleared the only F-SWE-1 migration blocker in the standalone
  prerequisite after WP-0 and before WP-1. No Tailwind or WP-1 work started.
- Plan vs implementation: as planned. `orchestrator.py` now imports
  `timezone` and passes `tzinfo=timezone.utc` to both listening-year boundary
  constructors. The regression drives the public `fetch_top_albums_async`
  workflow, simulates UTC-5 semantics only for naive constructors, and checks
  the literal UTC epoch values sent to the mocked Last.fm boundary. Existing
  mock track fixtures now construct their UTS values in explicit UTC too.
- TDD red evidence: before the production fix,
  `pytest -q tests/services/test_lastfm_logic.py::test_fetch_top_albums_uses_utc_year_window_on_non_utc_host`
  failed twice with the same boundary shift:

  ```text
  AssertionError: expected await not found.
  Expected: mock('testuser', 1704067200, 1735689599, progress_cb=None)
    Actual: mock('testuser', 1704085200, 1735707599, progress_cb=None)
  ```

  After the fix, the targeted test passed, and the complete test module passed
  with 8 tests.
- Deviations: no implementation deviation. Pre-push whole-file review corrected
  the README test badge and module inventory plus two forward-looking WP-7
  claims that still described WP-7 as the first test-count change. The same-day
  docsync source order gives live side-task entries precedence over
  current-batch entries, so the document-map entry below carries a later-count
  addendum that points back to this entry. Its original 590-test completion
  result stays unchanged.
  F-SWE-3 remains P2, F-B21-1 remains P1 without blocking WP-1, and root
  hygiene remains deferred until after WP-1.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **591 passed**, 3 warnings.
  `pre-commit run --all-files` -- all hooks pass; all tracked Markdown hashes
  match before and after the hook. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0 with
  the expected active-root `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` warning.
- Forward guidance: F-SWE-2 is resolved. WP-1 is next; pause for owner review
  of this commit before starting it.

### 2026-08-20 - PR #172 frontend-gate contract made executable (Batch 21 WP-0)

- Scope: addressed the two actionable P1 review threads on the active Batch 21
  definition before WP-1. This is design and state documentation only; no
  frontend runtime or WP-1 work started.
- Verification of the review findings: criterion 9 required the frontend gate
  at every WP while the validation section created it at WP-2, making WP-1
  impossible to complete. The planned Python script also had no declared
  Playwright package, browser provisioning, CI setup, or callable bridge to
  the machine-local MCP providers.
- Plan vs implementation: owner-approved as designed. The three existing
  repository gates remain mandatory at every WP and the frontend gate starts
  at WP-2. That WP pins `playwright==1.62.0` in `requirements-dev.txt`, installs
  its matching Chromium build explicitly on the developer machine and Linux
  CI, runs the repository gate in the Quality Gate, and documents setup in
  README and DEVELOPMENT when the runtime lands. The script owns an ephemeral
  loopback Flask server and always tears it down; missing tooling fails with an
  actionable command rather than downloading silently. No Node project,
  pytest plugin, or MCP dependency is introduced.
- Review disposition outside this commit: the nuanced F-SWE-3 thread received
  the owner-approved ROI explanation and was resolved without expanding WP-7.
  F-SWE-3 remains open at P2; operational Spotify failures do not become an
  unmatched-page `reason_code`.
- Deviations: none. The active definition is the canonical design document, so
  no duplicate `docs/superpowers/specs/` file was created.
- Validation: qualified `pytest -q` -- **591 passed**, 3 warnings; all
  pre-commit hooks passed; tracked-Markdown MD5 manifests were identical
  before and after the hook run; `doc_state_sync.py --check` passed with only
  the expected active-batch root-definition warning.
- Forward guidance: land PR #172, then start WP-1. The Playwright dependency,
  browser download, workflow change, gate implementation, tests, README, and
  DEVELOPMENT updates all land together at WP-2.

### 2026-08-20 - Tailwind and daisyUI toolchain completed (Batch 21 WP-1)

- Scope: added the Node-free pinned Tailwind/daisyUI toolchain, themes,
  committed compiled CSS, and Linux CI rebuild. No templates changed and
  `scripts/dev/dev_start.py` remains unchanged.
- Plan vs implementation: Tailwind v4.3.3 and daisyUI v5.7.19 pin seven
  platform assets -- Windows x64, macOS x64 and arm64, Linux x64 and arm64
  for glibc and musl -- plus `daisyui.mjs` and `daisyui-theme.mjs`. Every
  artifact is SHA-256-verified on every use; one verified atomic replacement
  follows an invalid cache entry. The source restricts daisyUI to button,
  card, modal, toggle, input, select, tab, toast, and alert; it locks the
  reviewed light/dark palette, type scale, 4px spacing ladder, 8/14/999px
  radii, and both `--bars-color` aliases. CI caches `scripts/bin/` by runner
  OS, architecture, and build-script hash.
- TDD evidence: initial collection failed for the missing
  `scripts.dev.tailwind_build` module; cache tests first failed on the absent
  cache interface; source-contract tests first failed on absent
  `static/css/tailwind.src.css`. Focused green commands were
  `pytest tests/scripts/dev/test_tailwind_build.py -q`,
  `pytest tests/scripts/dev/test_tailwind_build_cli.py -q`, and
  `pytest tests/scripts/dev/test_tailwind_build.py tests/scripts/dev/test_tailwind_build_cli.py -q`
  (35 passed).
- Reproducibility: Windows and the `python:3.13-slim` headless glibc-Linux
  probe both produced SHA-256
  `481230ebf858f2fe3b0497c7247be3532917e1c6432cd2bde0940721e81d1b09`.
  The Quality Gate is configured to rebuild with the same Linux x64 asset.
  It has not run yet, because the branch is unpushed.
- Documentation: DEVELOPMENT owns commands; README links rather than copying;
  BATCH21_DEFINITION owns the CI decision; exact pins and digests live in code.
- Deviations: owner-approved fail-closed hardening distinguishes only `None`
  as omitted, so explicit empty platform values cannot probe the live host,
  with deterministic `required_artifacts()` matrix coverage. Same-date
  live-side precedence also required this minimal pointer addendum and the
  deterministic rotation of one older non-current entry; point-in-time history
  was not rewritten. For the four final-review peer-size findings, the owner
  ruled that the cap is flexible when it prevents only files that are
  tremendously out of place or becoming god-files. The plan remains one
  reviewed execution contract, generated `tailwind.css` is indivisible, the
  builder owns one cohesive standard-library toolchain responsibility, and its
  tests stay beside that public seam. None is a god-file or out of place, so
  no split was made and `AGENTS.md` remains unchanged. Final review also
  found both musl pins unreachable: `platform.libc_ver()` reports nothing on
  musl and `libc` on some glibc hosts, so the plan's direct
  `platform.libc_ver()[0]` check gave way to `_normalize_libc()` and
  `_detect_libc()`, which probes for the musl loader. Verified in Docker on
  `python:3.13-alpine` and `python:3.13-slim`. The plan keeps its original
  code listing as the reviewed design.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **633 passed**, 3 warnings. All pre-commit hooks
  passed; tracked-Markdown manifests were identical before and after the hook;
  `doc_state_sync.py --fix` exited 0 with the expected active root-definition
  warning for `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md`.
- Forward guidance: owner review first; the root-hygiene side task is next;
  WP-2 follows it. WP-2 keeps the cache, removes the direct CI build step only
  when its drift hook lands, and adds the first Tailwind-consuming template.

### 2026-08-23 - Base shell, error-page pilot, and two new gates (Batch 21 WP-2)

- Scope: the first Tailwind template. Added the standing header bar, moved
  Bootstrap and `global.css` into a per-page block, migrated `error.html`,
  and built the two gates that protect the rest of the migration.
- Plan vs implementation: the plan is
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-22-batch21-wp2-base-shell.md`, 13 tasks in
  five commits. All 13 landed.
  - The Adobe Fonts reversal was recorded first, then the theme tokens moved
    to kit `rwy8ghw`. `--font-weight-medium` and `--font-weight-semibold`
    were deleted: the kit serves 300, 400 and 700 only, so those two tokens
    could only ever produce a synthesized fake weight.
  - `tailwind-css-drift` rebuilds and diffs on every commit. It sets
    `always_run` and `pass_filenames: false` because the top-level exclude
    filters out `static/`, so a filename-driven hook would never run on the
    one file it exists to check.
  - `scripts/dev/frontend_gate.py` serves the app on a loopback port it owns
    and drives Chromium. Four checks: exactly one framework stylesheet per
    page, `--bars-color` equal to the theme primary with no cool grey left,
    the theme surviving a reload, and all five kit families resolving as
    loaded faces.
  - `base.html` sets `data-theme` before first paint, links the kit, and
    carries the header bar. `theme.js` dual-writes `data-theme` and
    `.dark-mode` until WP-8 retires the second write.
- Deviations, each owner-approved or recorded here:
  - **The legacy CSS block defaults ON.** The plan left it empty and had each
    unmigrated page opt in. The owner inverted it on 2026-08-23, so a
    forgotten template keeps its theme and only a migrated page opts out.
    Forgetting is now safe instead of silently broken.
  - **`templates/inline/scrobble_scope_lockup_inline.svg` is new.** The
    design system reserves the lockup for the header and keeps the full mark
    with tagline for social use. No lockup asset was imported, so this one is
    derived from the existing wordmark by removing the tagline group and
    tightening the viewBox. The letterform paths are unchanged.
  - **`tests/test_template_shell.py` is new and not in the plan.** The plan
    says nothing in `pytest` catches a missed legacy block. Twenty tests now
    do, across all five templates. Emptying the block in `base.html` fails
    eight of them.
  - **The direct CI Tailwind build step was removed** rather than kept beside
    the hook, which is what the batch definition's CI decision says. A digest
    print survives as a separate diagnostic step, because the hook proves
    only that the committed file matches a rebuild on that runner and says
    nothing about Windows against Linux.
  - **`tests/conftest.py` was fixed alongside the gate.** Both used
    `os.environ.setdefault` for `SECRET_KEY`. Actions sets that variable to
    an empty string when the secret is missing, and empty is present, so
    `setdefault` does nothing and the app refuses to boot.
  - **The gate's theme-persistence check runs on a migrated page**, not the
    index, because the welcome modal's backdrop covers the header there.
    Filed as `F-B21-11`; WP-3 deletes that modal.
- Findings: `F-B21-2` and `F-B21-7` resolved, and `F-AUDIT-1` resolved by the
  44px header targets. `F-B21-10` filed -- every error page reports 400
  whatever the real status, and the fix lives in files WP-7 reserves.
  `F-B21-11` filed. Neither is mirrored to a GitHub issue; `F-B21-9` records
  that the mirror is manual.
- Known gap, recorded rather than fixed: the gate's four browser checks have
  no unit coverage, though its runtime does. A check that quietly stops
  asserting looks exactly like a check that passes, so this is worth closing
  with one stub-page assertion each in a later work package.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **666 passed**, 3 warnings. All 11 pre-commit
  hooks pass, and `git write-tree` is identical before and after. The
  frontend gate reports `4 checks passed`, and it was proven able to fail:
  it reported ten real failures before the shell landed.
  `doc_state_sync.py --check` exits 0 with the expected active
  root-definition warning.
- Forward guidance: owner visual review of the error page in both themes
  before WP-3. Do not push the gate commit on its own -- the workflow runs on
  push to `wip/**`, and the gate fails until the shell commit lands with it.
  WP-3 takes the index page, deletes the welcome modal, and adds its page to
  `MIGRATED_PAGES` in the gate.

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->

### 2026-08-24 - F-B21-13 docsync bootstrap gate remediated (side-task)

- Scope: closed `F-B21-13` with DOC007 and DOC008 on
  `wip/f-b21-13-docsync-gate`, branched from `origin/main` at `658bdb2`;
  WP-3 remains on `wip/batch-21`.
- DOC007 now has one next-WP calculation. The managed SESSION_CONTEXT
  renderer owns `_next_wp_number()`, the integrity check calls that helper,
  and the CLI supplies the active definition's finite plan. Absorbed,
  dropped and merged WP headings are skipped; a fully completed plan
  terminates with no next package instead of looping forever. The definition
  Status line and PLAYBOOK Section 3's actual Next action bullet are checked
  against that same value. Historical claims outside the bullet and earlier
  claims superseded inside it cannot steal the comparison.
- DOC008 applies `latest_test_count_authority()` to the FINDINGS.md header
  with findings-specific remediation. Authority includes live entries, the
  side-task archive and per-batch logs; a same-date tie between batch logs is
  resolved by numeric batch chronology rather than filename insertion order.
- Review remediation also repaired two misleading DOC007 fixtures so their
  asserted WP ranges really sit inside the current-batch markers. Every new
  edge case was observed failing before its minimal fix.
- Deviations: the owner authorized expanding the original PR file set on
  2026-08-24 after the audit proved DOC007 and the renderer computed different
  next-WP values. The expansion is limited to the renderer/sync/CLI data path
  and its directly related docsync tests; no unrelated refactor was taken.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **713 passed**, 3 warnings (was 682; 31 new
  tests across the docsync integrity, renderer, logic, CLI and count suites).
  The focused docsync suite is **215 passed**.
- Forward guidance: WP-3 should still update the definition Status line as
  an explicit task. The gate proves agreement; it does not replace writing
  the canonical status correctly.

### 2026-08-23 - PR #216 review round three applied (side-task)

- Scope: two review comments on `e9bac27`, both real rendering defects in
  WP-2's own shell commit. Both were verified in a browser before any edit.
- **The header wordmark ignored `prefers-reduced-motion`.** The lockup
  carried five SMIL `<animate>` elements with `repeatCount="indefinite"`.
  No CSS can pause SMIL, so the media query in `shell.css` never reached
  them. WP-2 made the exposure much worse: the mark moved from per-page
  hero content that scrolls away into a fixed header that is on every page
  and never leaves the viewport. `docs/design/README.md` already prescribed
  the remedy and says the SMIL must be stripped and the bars animated from
  CSS. Done, with the keyframes taken from `docs/design/tokens/base.css`.
- **A wrong assumption was caught by measuring.** The origin looked like it
  needed a 7-unit correction, because this lockup's viewBox starts at y=7
  where the full mark starts at y=0. It does not: `view-box` resolves
  `transform-origin` in the SVG user coordinate system, not from the
  viewBox corner. At `scaleY(3)` the proposed 56.5px slid each bar bottom
  8.4px and the canonical 63.5px held it to 0.2px. Under the shipped 1.10
  scale the gap is under half a pixel, so eyeballing would have missed it.
- **The back-to-top control lost its layout.** `base.html` used to wrap the
  theme toggle and `page_footer_extra` together in `.page-footer-bar`. WP-2
  moved the toggle into the header and removed the wrapper with it, but
  `results.html` still fills that block and `#back-to-top` has no CSS of its
  own anywhere. Centring, gap, padding and entrance all came from the
  wrapper, so the control shipped bare and left-aligned. Restored in
  `shell.css` rather than `global.css`, which only reaches unmigrated pages.
- Both guards were proven able to fail. Putting one `<animate>` back fails
  five tests, reflowing the wrapper onto three lines fails four, and
  dropping the reduced-motion `opacity: 1` fails one.
- Deviations: the frontend gate gained no reduced-motion check. Its checks
  take a page rather than a browser, so a second context needs a signature
  change, and that is a refactor rather than a review fix. The template
  tests cover the markup and the CSS; the computed behaviour was verified
  by hand this round.
- Findings: `F-B21-5` updated rather than closed. The header instance is
  resolved; the pinwheel and the index hero wordmark still carry SMIL and
  belong to WP-3.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **682 passed**, 3 warnings. All 11 pre-commit
  hooks pass. The frontend gate reports `5 checks passed`.
  `doc_state_sync.py --check` exits 0 with the expected active
  root-definition warning.
- Forward guidance: strip the SMIL from the remaining two assets the same
  way. Do not reach for `svg.pauseAnimations()` -- the CSS route is what the
  design contract asks for and it needs no JavaScript.

### 2026-08-23 - PR #216 review round two applied (side-task)

- Scope: two review comments on `4105aef`, both documentation. Both were
  verified against the files and both were valid.
- **The batch definition still said WP-2 was next.** PLAYBOOK Section 3 and
  `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` Section 1 both said WP-3. `AGENTS.md` makes those
  three agreeing the condition for bootstrap to complete, so the next agent
  would have stopped on the disagreement. `git log -S` puts the line's last
  edit in `7c00754`, the WP-1 commit. WP-1's plan listed updating it as a
  task and WP-2's did not.
- **The findings header still published 666 tests.** The round-one commit
  moved PLAYBOOK and SESSION_CONTEXT to 671 and left that copy behind. It is
  the instance-not-class anti-pattern `AGENTS.md` names, committed inside the
  commit that was fixing stale documentation.
- Every other `666` in a tracked document was checked rather than assumed.
  The remaining three are dated log entries that were accurate when written,
  so they stay.
- **`F-B21-13` filed for the class.** Neither line is read by any gate.
  `doc_state_sync.py` derives the next work package from PLAYBOOK and never
  reads the batch definition, and the test-count enforcement in
  `scripts/docsync/integrity.py` covers SESSION_CONTEXT only. The definition
  status line has now gone stale twice -- PR #170 corrected it once for
  WP-1 -- which is the point at which `AGENTS.md` prefers a mechanical check
  over another written rule.
- Deviations: the gate was not extended in this round. It is a change to the
  integrity checks every work package depends on, and scope discipline puts
  that in a finding rather than in an open UI PR.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **671 passed**, 3 warnings. All 11 pre-commit
  hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` exits 0 with the expected active
  root-definition warning.
- Forward guidance: WP-3 should carry updating the definition status line as
  an explicit task, the way WP-1 did, until `F-B21-13` closes.

### 2026-08-23 - PR #216 review round one applied (side-task)

- Scope: three review comments Codex left on `45fbbe8`. All three were
  verified against the code and all three were valid. None was declined.
- **Tailwind was pruning tokens the handwritten CSS reads.** Tailwind v4
  emits a theme variable only when a generated utility uses it.
  `static/css/error.css` reads `--font-figure`, `--font-weight-bold`,
  `--spacing-8`, `--radius-sm` and `--radius-lg` directly, no utility used
  them, and none reached `static/css/tailwind.css`. An undefined `var()`
  with no fallback voids the whole declaration, so the error page shipped
  with no card rounding and no page padding, and its status number took
  neither the bold weight nor the Gotham face. Nothing failed and nothing
  logged. `@theme static` fixes it and adds 16 declarations to the compiled
  file. A browser now reports 14px card rounding and 32px 16px page
  padding.
- **No page set `font-family` on `body`.** Neither `global.css` nor
  `shell.css` carried one, so the four unmigrated pages downloaded the
  Adobe kit and then rendered in the Bootstrap system stack. The batch
  definition lists the body font as a WP-2 deliverable, so this was a
  missed one rather than a new idea. The declaration went into `shell.css`
  behind a new `--shell-font-sans` token, because an unmigrated page never
  loads the compiled stylesheet and `var(--font-sans)` resolves to nothing
  there.
- **`SESSION_CONTEXT.md` sections 3 and 4 were stale.** They said 9 css and
  7 js files, still listed a deleted `error.js`, and omitted `shell.css`,
  `frontend_gate.py` and the lockup SVG. Real counts are 10 and 6.
- Two gaps closed while in the same files. `tests/test_template_shell.py`
  gains a test that renders each page, reads back the stylesheets it loads,
  and asserts every `var()` without a fallback resolves in one of them.
  Nothing checked that invariant before. The gate gains a fifth check for
  the body font, reading computed style rather than stylesheet text,
  because the failure is a cascade one and only a browser can settle it.
- Deviations: the dependency graph also gained `dev/tailwind_build.py`,
  which WP-1 added and never recorded. It was a one-line omission in the
  block being corrected, so leaving it was worse than fixing it.
- Both fixes were proven able to fail. Reverting `@theme static` fails two
  tests, and removing the body declaration fails the gate on `/` and names
  the system stack it fell back to.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **671 passed**, 3 warnings. All 11 pre-commit
  hooks pass. The frontend gate reports `5 checks passed`.
  `doc_state_sync.py --check` exits 0 with the expected active
  root-definition warning.
- Forward guidance: the compiled stylesheet is 1,650 lines now, so every
  line citation into it is stale again. Cite the block, not the number.
