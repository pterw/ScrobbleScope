# ScrobbleScope Execution Playbook

Date: 2026-02-22
Purpose: Single source of truth for work sequencing and execution history.
Rules for agent behaviour live in `AGENTS.md`; current-state snapshot in
`.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. Why this document exists

- Provide a single source of truth for work sequencing.
- Enable continuation by another agent with minimal context loss.
- Prevent risky refactor-first changes before parity tests exist.

**Implementation principles:**
1. Approval tests before structural refactor.
2. No behavior-breaking refactors without parity checks.
3. Add observability before optimization where possible.
4. Keep changes batch-scoped and reversible.
5. Keep security-safe rendering (`tojson`, escaping) as baseline.

## 2. Batch order (strict sequence)

Completed batch definitions are archived individually under `docs/history/`.

### Completed batches (definitions archived)

### Open decisions (owner confirmation needed)

1. Persistent store choice: Postgres only or Postgres + Redis.
2. Retry UX policy: immediate retry button only, or retry + cooldown messaging.
3. Error copy style and user-facing tone for upstream failures.

## 3. Active batch + next action

- **Batch 18 is complete.** All 5 WPs done. Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH18_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 19 is complete.** All 5 WPs done plus owner-review follow-up.
  Definition archived: `docs/history/definitions/BATCH19_DEFINITION.md`.
  PR #152 (Batches 18 + 19) merged to `main`.
- **Batch 20 is complete.** All 9 WPs done (WP-0 through WP-5 via PR #159
  on `file-hygeine`; audit gap-fix follow-up, WP-6, WP-7, and WP-8 on
  `wip/batch-20`, submitted as PR #162). Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH20_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 21 is not yet defined.** Definition stub: `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md`
  (repo root). Scope TBD -- global UI overhaul (font stack, palette
  integration, index card rework, Bootstrap CDN consolidation) driven by
  the owner's audit PDF; owner is drafting the UI proposal now. No WP
  work begins until the definition is approved and committed.
- **Next action:** await Batch 21 scope from the owner's UI proposal,
  then expand `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` into WPs.
- **Perf note (measured 2026-05-16):** Heatmap fetch for `flounder14`
  (103 pages) took 10.9s. `lastfm.py` already uses `limit=200` and concurrent
  `as_completed` fetching. 10.9s is the rate-limit floor (103 pages /
  10 req/s = 10.3s minimum). No further optimization without heatmap-specific
  caching or rate-limit risk. Documented in FINDINGS.md F-B18-11.
- **Last.timer note (checked 2026-05-19):** the referenced project uses
  aggregate `user.gettopartists`/`user.gettoptracks` calls with page fan-out,
  not exact per-scrobble recent-track timestamps. Useful for future perf
  research, but not a drop-in heatmap speedup. See FINDINGS.md F-B19-3.
- Future feature candidates (confirmed by owner roadmap):
  - **Top songs** (future): rank most-played tracks for a year (Last.fm + possibly
    Spotify enrichment, separate background task + loading/results flow).

## 4. Execution log (for agent handoff)

Keep only the active window here: current batch entries plus the latest 4
non-current operational logs. Older dated entries live in
`docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.

**How to read dated entries:**
- Each heading `YYYY-MM-DD - ...` is a completion/addendum log.
- Untagged side-task history: `docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Tagged batch history: per-batch logs under `docs/history/logs/`.
- Batch scope/acceptance criteria: definitions under `docs/history/definitions/`.
- Current-batch boundaries are machine-managed (do not move entries manually):
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->`
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->`
- After any edit here, run `python scripts/doc_state_sync.py --fix`.
- Archive search: `rg -n "^### 20" docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->

### 2026-07-24 - Batch 20 complete; definition archived, log purged (Batch 20 close-out)

- Scope: Batch 20 WP-8 close-out per the AGENTS.md procedure.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `doc_state_sync.py --fix --keep-non-current 0` purged the 4 rotated
    non-current side-task entries into the monolith archive.
  - `git mv BATCH20_DEFINITION.md docs/history/definitions/` and marked
    the archived definition header Complete.
  - PLAYBOOK Section 2: Batch 20 row now links to the archived
    definition. Section 3: Batch 20 marked complete; Batch 21 (UI
    overhaul) flagged as next, awaiting the owner's in-progress UI
    proposal.
  - `.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` Section 1: Batch 20 row set to
    Complete (all 9 WPs); Batch 21 row set to next-batch status. The
    "22 test modules" wording was already correct from earlier WPs.
- Deviations: none. Batch ran WP-0..WP-5 via Copilot PRs (#153/#155/
  #156/#159), then a post-merge audit follow-up commit plus WP-6, WP-7,
  and this close-out on `wip/batch-20` in a worktree.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0 with only the
  expected `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` root warning remaining.
- Forward guidance: next batch is Batch 21 (UI overhaul); expand
  `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` into WPs once the owner's proposal lands.
  `wip/batch-20` holds four unpushed commits awaiting owner review and
  push/PR instruction.

### 2026-07-24 - PR #162 review response (side-task)

- Scope: address the Copilot review on PR #162 (Batch 20 completion).
  All six comments (four inline + two suppressed low-confidence) were
  valid doc-consistency catches; five acted on fully, one partially.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `FINDINGS.md`: header status updated to Batch 20 complete / Batch 21
    next; `Source:` added to F-B20-4 and F-B18-11; `Status:` lines added
    to all P2, Info, and feature items; shipped F-FEATURE-2 rotated to
    the archive with a cross-reference note.
  - `AGENTS.md` Finding-Writing Rules: rotation rule clarified --
    standing design-decision Info items (F-LOAD-3..5) keep their F-IDs
    in the active file and rotate only when superseded. This is the
    partial decline: archiving them would contradict the Batch 20
    definition's WP-6 intent.
  - `docs/history/findings/FINDINGS_ARCHIVE.md`: header claim narrowed
    to ID/history preservation (bodies may be condensed at rotation).
  - `PLAYBOOK.md` Section 3: "unpushed pending owner instruction"
    replaced with "submitted as PR #162" (the Section 4 close-out entry
    keeps the original wording as a point-in-time record).
  - `AGENT_NOTES.md`: stale "Batch 20 is now active" block updated to
    complete/archived status with Batch 21 next.
  - `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md`: baseline refreshed 389 -> 390.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.
- Forward guidance: batched reply posted on PR #162; awaiting merge.
  Batch 21 scope expansion remains next once the owner's UI proposal
  lands.

### 2026-07-24 - PR #162 review response, round 2 (side-task)

- Scope: address Copilot's second review round on PR #162 (four inline
  comments + one suppressed). All five verified valid; all acted on.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `FINDINGS.md` F-MAS-4: `except Exception` count updated 14 -> 17
    (verified by grep; Copilot's per-file breakdown was exact) with the
    recount date noted.
  - `FINDINGS.md` deferred-block pointer corrected: detailed bodies live
    in pre-Batch-20 FINDINGS.md via git history (before `494f2c7`), not
    under `docs/history/` as previously claimed.
  - `FINDINGS.md` F-FEATURE-2 cross-reference recast as a direct
    sentence (grammar).
  - `docs/history/findings/FINDINGS_ARCHIVE.md`: F-FEATURE-2 heading
    suffix normalized to `-- RESOLVED (shipped in Batches 18/19)` per
    the AGENTS.md suffix rule.
  - Archived `BATCH20_DEFINITION.md` header relabeled `Baseline:` ->
    `Final count:` so it no longer conflicts with the definition's
    unchanged 389-baseline plan text.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.
- Forward guidance: PR #162 ready for merge; Batch 21 definition draft
  sits uncommitted in the worktree awaiting owner approval.

### 2026-07-24 - PR #162 review response, round 3 (side-task)

- Scope: Copilot round 3 (two comments + one suppressed duplicate).
  One acted on, one declined.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - Acted: both F-B19-6 archive headings moved their portion qualifier
    after the colon to match the `F-<context>-<N>: <title>` format the
    batch itself established (AGENTS.md Finding-Writing Rules).
  - Declined: updating the `BATCH20_DEFINITION.md:107-108` citation
    inside the archived `docs/history/logs/BATCH20_LOG.md` WP-3 entry.
    Rotated log entries are point-in-time records (same principle as
    the round-1 "unpushed" decline, which the reviewer accepted), they
    are machine-rotated content the docsync tooling owns, and the
    filename remains uniquely greppable at its archived location.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.
- Forward guidance: review rounds are now in pure-style territory;
  recommend merging PR #162.

### 2026-07-24 - PR #162 review response, round 4 (side-task)

- Scope: Copilot round 4 -- one comment on PLAYBOOK Section 3 batch-state
  wording. Acted on, with a corrected mechanism note.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - Section 3 now uses the parser-recognized marker "Batch 21 is not yet
    defined"; the Section 3 parse verifiably returns the between-batches
    state with that wording in place.
  - Verified the comment's mechanism was doubly off: `BATCH_NEXT_RE`
    does not match "Batch 21 is next" (the attribution came from the
    `last_completed + 1` fallback at `parser.py:198-199`), and the
    wording fix alone cannot change the rendered STATUS -- with the
    close-out entry still inside the CURRENT-BATCH markers,
    `renderer.py:85-86` applies its own `last_completed + 1` fallback.
    Batch 19 precedent shows this is transient: its identically-tagged
    close-out entry rotated out automatically when Batch 20 WP-0 landed,
    and the same will happen at Batch 21 WP-0.
  - Logged the renderer gap as F-DOCSYNC-2 (open P2) rather than
    hand-moving machine-managed marker content or patching docsync code
    inside a docs-only PR.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.
- Forward guidance: owner is merging PR #162; Batch 21 opens next.
