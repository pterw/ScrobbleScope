# ScrobbleScope Execution Playbook

Date: 2026-02-22
Purpose: Single source of truth for work sequencing and execution history.
Rules for agent behaviour live in `AGENTS.md`; current-state snapshot in
`.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. Why this document exists

- Provide a single source of truth for work sequencing.
- Enable continuation by another agent with minimal context loss.
- Prevent risky refactor-first changes before parity tests exist.

**Implementation principles:**
1. Approval tests before structural refactor.
2. No behavior-breaking refactors without parity checks.
3. Add observability before optimization where possible.
4. Keep changes batch-scoped and reversible.
5. Keep security-safe rendering (`tojson`, escaping) as baseline.

## 2. Batch order (strict sequence)

Completed batch definitions are archived individually under `docs/history/`.

### Completed batches (definitions archived)

| Batch | Title | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 0 | Baseline freeze + approval parity suite | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH0_DEFINITION.md` |
| 1 | Proper upstream failure state + retry UX | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH1_DEFINITION.md` |
| 2 | Personalized minimum listening year | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH2_DEFINITION.md` |
| 3 | Remove nested thread pattern | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH3_DEFINITION.md` |
| 4 | Expand test coverage significantly | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH4_DEFINITION.md` |
| 5 | Docstring + comment normalization | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH5_DEFINITION.md` |
| 6 | Frontend refinement/tweaks | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH6_DEFINITION.md` |
| 7 | Persistent metadata layer (Postgres) | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH7_DEFINITION.md` |
| 8 | Modular refactor (app factory + blueprints) | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH8_DEFINITION.md` |
| 9 | Audit remediation (WP-1 through WP-8) | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH9_DEFINITION.md` |
| 10 | Gemini audit remediation (WP-1 through WP-9) | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH10_DEFINITION_2026-02-21.md` |
| 11 | Gemini Priority 2 audit remediation (SoC, DRY, architecture) | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH11_DEFINITION.md` |
| 12 | Polish and observability (CSS, formatting, SoC, progress) | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH12_DEFINITION.md` |
| 13 | Internal decomposition and coverage hardening | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH13_DEFINITION.md` |
| 14 | Doc hygiene (archive restructure, docsync package, per-batch routing) | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH14_DEFINITION.md` |
| 15 | Alignment, hardening, and handoff | `docs/history/definitions/BATCH15_DEFINITION.md` |

### Open decisions (owner confirmation needed)

1. Persistent store choice: Postgres only or Postgres + Redis.
2. Retry UX policy: immediate retry button only, or retry + cooldown messaging.
3. Error copy style and user-facing tone for upstream failures.

## 3. Active batch + next action

- **Batch 15 is complete.** Alignment, Hardening, and Handoff. All 6 WPs done.
  Definition: `docs/history/definitions/BATCH15_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Current mode:** No active batch.
  - WP-1: align Python version to 3.13 in Dockerfile + CI, fix deploy wording. **Done.**
    - Deviation: docsync `--fix` SESSION_CONTEXT write bug discovered and fixed (+1 test, 311 total). **Done.**
  - WP-2: fix stale counts in README and SESSION_CONTEXT. **Done.**
  - WP-3: reject malformed `### ` headings in docsync parser + 3 tests. **Done.**
  - WP-4: add 6 negative/boundary tests for docsync renderer and logic. **Done.**
  - WP-5: replace HANDOFF_PROMPT.md with minimal stable cross-agent template. **Done.**
  - WP-6: add proposal discipline and anti-pattern rules to AGENTS.md. **Done.**
- **Batch 14 is complete.** All 5 WPs done + staleness fix side-task.
  Definition: `docs/history/definitions/BATCH14_DEFINITION.md`.
- Future batch feature candidates (confirmed by owner roadmap, batch number TBD):
  - **Top songs**: rank most-played tracks for a year (Last.fm + possibly
    Spotify enrichment, separate background task + loading/results flow).
  - **Listening heatmap**: scrobble density calendar for last 365 days
    (Last.fm-only, lighter background task).
- Do not start feature work (top songs, heatmap) until owner defines scope
  and assigns a batch number.

## 4. Execution log (for agent handoff)

Keep only the active window here: current batch entries plus the latest 4
non-current operational logs. Older dated entries live in
`docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.

**How to read dated entries:**
- Each heading `YYYY-MM-DD - ...` is a completion/addendum log.
- Untagged side-task history: `docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Tagged batch history: per-batch logs under `docs/history/logs/`.
- Batch scope/acceptance criteria: definitions under `docs/history/definitions/`.
- Current-batch boundaries are machine-managed (do not move entries manually):
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->`
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->`
- After any edit here, run `python scripts/doc_state_sync.py --fix`.
- Archive search: `rg -n "^### 20" docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->

### 2026-03-03 - Fix SESSION_CONTEXT.md commit convention and stage accumulated changes

**Scope:** Side-task -- documentation and gitignore fix, no code changes.

**What:** SESSION_CONTEXT.md was never staged in the two previous side-task commits
(`c4bf737`, `4f1cf6a`) despite commit messages implying it. SESSION_CONTEXT.md has
been git-tracked since before `edee612` (when `.claude/` was added to .gitignore).
The `.gitignore` entry `.claude/` is misleading -- SESSION_CONTEXT.md is grandfathered
in as a tracked file. Fix: update `.gitignore` to `.claude/*` + `!.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`
so the exception is explicit. Fix AGENTS.md: remove incorrect "SESSION_CONTEXT is
gitignored" language. Stage the accumulated SESSION_CONTEXT.md changes (Batch 15 state
update, Section 8 browser MCP note, Section 8 local Postgres note).

**Why:** SESSION_CONTEXT.md is the shared cross-agent dashboard. All agents (Gemini,
Copilot, Codex, Claude Code) bootstrap from it. Leaving it uncommitted means every agent
starts with stale branch, test count, and batch status. The gitignore fix makes the
tracked-exception visible and prevents future agents from falsely concluding the file
is machine-local.

**Validation:** `pytest -q` -- **320 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files` -- all hooks pass.
`python scripts/doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.

**Forward guidance:** No batch active. BATCH16_PROPOSAL.md written; awaiting owner review.

### 2026-03-03 - Add local DB setup and init_db.py caveat to env docs

**Scope:** Side-task -- documentation only, no code changes.

**What:** Added local Postgres DB setup details and `init_db.py` load_dotenv caveat
to AGENTS.md Environment Setup and SESSION_CONTEXT Section 8. These facts apply to
all agents (Gemini CLI, Copilot, Codex, Claude Code) running local DB tests.

**Why:** `init_db.py` has no `load_dotenv()` call. Any agent running it will get
"DATABASE_URL not set" unless the env var is set directly in the shell. Absent from
canonical docs, every agent would hit this silently and assume cache is unavailable.

**Validation:** `pytest -q` -- **320 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files` -- all hooks pass.
`python scripts/doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.

**Forward guidance:** No batch active. Awaiting owner scope definition for next batch.

### 2026-03-03 - Add browser MCP environment note to SESSION_CONTEXT

**Scope:** Side-task -- documentation only, no code changes.

**What:** Added one line to SESSION_CONTEXT Section 8 (Environment notes) documenting
that the browser MCP accesses the local Flask app via `http://host.docker.internal:5000/`
rather than `localhost`, because the MCP browser runs inside a Docker container.

**Why:** This is a runtime fact that future agent sessions need to reproduce local
browser testing correctly. Absent from SESSION_CONTEXT, an agent would attempt
`localhost` and get a connection refused error with no clear diagnosis path.

**Validation:** `pytest -q` -- **320 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files` -- all hooks pass.
`python scripts/doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.

**Forward guidance:** No batch active. Awaiting owner scope definition for next batch.
