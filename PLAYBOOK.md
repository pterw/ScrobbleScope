# ScrobbleScope Execution Playbook

Date: 2026-02-22
Purpose: Single source of truth for work sequencing and execution history.
Rules for agent behaviour live in `AGENTS.md`; current-state snapshot in
`.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. Why this document exists

- Provide a single source of truth for work sequencing.
- Enable continuation by another agent with minimal context loss.
- Prevent risky refactor-first changes before parity tests exist.

**Implementation principles:**
1. Approval tests before structural refactor.
2. No behavior-breaking refactors without parity checks.
3. Add observability before optimization where possible.
4. Keep changes batch-scoped and reversible.
5. Keep security-safe rendering (`tojson`, escaping) as baseline.

## 2. Batch order (strict sequence)

Completed batch definitions are archived individually under `docs/history/`.

A batch's close-out entry sits in its per-batch log only when the heading
carried a `(Batch N WP-X)` tag (as Batch 18's did). Close-outs tagged
`(Batch N close-out)` are not parser-recognized and were routed to the
monolith archive instead -- Batches 19 and 20 are the current examples.
See FINDINGS F-DOCSYNC-3.

### Open decisions (owner confirmation needed)

1. Persistent store choice: Postgres only or Postgres + Redis.
2. Retry UX policy: immediate retry button only, or retry + cooldown messaging.
3. Error copy style and user-facing tone for upstream failures.

## 3. Active batch + next action

- **Batch 18 is complete.** All 5 WPs done. Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH18_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 19 is complete.** All 5 WPs done plus owner-review follow-up.
  Definition archived: `docs/history/definitions/BATCH19_DEFINITION.md`.
  PR #152 (Batches 18 + 19) merged to `main`.
- **Batch 20 is complete.** All 9 WPs done (WP-0 through WP-5 via PR #159
  on `file-hygeine`; audit gap-fix follow-up, WP-6, WP-7, and WP-8 on
  `wip/batch-20`, submitted as PR #162). Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH20_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 21 is active.** Definition: `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` (repo
  root). Scope: UI overhaul -- Bootstrap 5.1.3 -> Tailwind v4 (standalone
  CLI) + daisyUI v5, warm heatmap-derived themes propagated app-wide,
  page-by-page strangler migration. Expanded from the owner's Claude
  Design audit (UI Audit v3); four owner decisions locked in the
  definition. Branch: `wip/batch-21` (worktree off `main`).
- **Next action:** **WP-4 continues from the canonical routing and navigation
  prerequisite completed on 2026-08-26.** The owner added four functional
  header destinations, canonical GET routes for every page state, friendly
  pre-search states, and the segmented Light/Dark control before the loading
  rebuild. The next implementation slice migrates `loading.html` to the
  unified wait panel and extends the frontend gate to that job-backed route.
  The original twelve-round Codex review closed at `77bb001`: all thirty threads
  were resolved, both Quality Gate runs passed, and the Codex connector
  recorded a thumbs-up. Three later Graphify passes produced advisory findings.
  Codex confirmed five defect classes: the root-font and saved-theme checks
  leaked state, declaration paths could escape the repository, and joining
  documents for wrapped regex matches lost the original per-line semantics;
  equivalent spellings of one repository path could also bypass a live
  in-memory document and read stale disk. All five are hardened at shared
  seams with regression tests. The remaining claims were disproved against
  section boundaries, source contracts, tests and live browser execution.
  GitHub remains the source of truth for the PR's integration state.
  `templates/partials/_loading.html` already exists and is framework-neutral
  -- WP-3 built it a work package early -- so WP-4 consumes that partial
  rather than writing one. `GET /loading` now supplies the route the gate
  needs; its job fixture and loading-specific checks still belong to WP-4.
  **WP-3 is complete.** It rebuilt `index.html` on Tailwind, deleted the
  welcome modal and the `bootstrap.Popover` hints, absorbed WP-6, and grew
  the frontend gate from four checks at one desktop viewport into a
  multi-profile regression suite. Codex raised thirty comments across twelve
  rounds; twenty-nine were valid, and one sizing premise was disproved but
  received its conservative remedy. All were actioned.
  Earlier context, still true: WP-2 **merged as PR #216** on 2026-08-24
  (`658bdb2`, rebase merge). It shipped the base shell, the `error.html`
  pilot, the Playwright runtime, the frontend gate and the compiled-CSS
  pre-commit hook, closing F-B21-2, F-B21-7 and F-AUDIT-1 and filing
  F-B21-10, F-B21-11 and F-B21-12. Codex raised seven comments across three
  rounds; every one was valid and all seven were fixed before the merge.
  Round three took the SMIL out of the header wordmark and gave the
  back-to-top control its wrapper back. PR #217 merged the same day
  (`8ed1650`), adding the DOC007 and DOC008 checks that close F-B21-13.
  `pip-audit` still reports its advisories without failing the gate, by
  design (F-B21-3). The root-hygiene side task is **closed**: the owner
  rejected the audience-banner scheme on 2026-08-20, and the config-file
  verdict landed in `DEPLOY.md`.
  Earlier context, still true: **PR #171 merged to `main` on 2026-08-19**
  (`bb187ae`, rebase merge) with zero unresolved review threads after eight
  rounds; `wip/batch-21` was realigned to it. `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` was
  amended the same day so the batch gate can fail on frontend work.
  PR #169 merged 2026-08-08 shipping the
  repository-integrity gate and read-only worktree guard, resolving
  F-DOCSYNC-5/F-WORKTREE-1/F-WORKTREE-2; three guard files exceed their
  directory peer caps, accepted as a deviation and tracked as F-WORKTREE-4,
  not silently. PR #170 merged 2026-08-12 (`5b060a2`), settling the guard and
  docsync sources the audit reads.
- Batch 21 WP status: WP-0, WP-1, WP-2 and WP-3 done; PR #218 is the completed
  WP-3 integration branch. The canonical routing/navigation prerequisite for
  WP-4 is done; the unified loading rebuild is next. WP-6 is absorbed into
  WP-3 and ships no commit of its own. WP-4, WP-5, WP-7 and WP-8 are not done.
- **Perf note:** heatmap fetch speed is rate-limit bound; measurement and
  rationale live in FINDINGS.md F-B18-11 (single source).
- **Last.timer note (checked 2026-05-19):** the referenced project uses
  aggregate `user.gettopartists`/`user.gettoptracks` calls with page fan-out,
  not exact per-scrobble recent-track timestamps. Useful for future perf
  research, but not a drop-in heatmap speedup. See FINDINGS.md F-B19-3.
- Future feature candidates (confirmed by owner roadmap):
  - **Top songs** (future): rank most-played tracks for a year (Last.fm + possibly
    Spotify enrichment, separate background task + loading/results flow).

## 4. Execution log (for agent handoff)

Keep only the active window here: current batch entries plus the latest 4
non-current operational logs. Older dated entries live in
`docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.

**How to read dated entries:**
- Each heading `YYYY-MM-DD - ...` is a completion/addendum log.
- Untagged side-task history: `docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Tagged batch history: per-batch logs under `docs/history/logs/`.
- Batch scope/acceptance criteria: definitions under `docs/history/definitions/`.
- Current-batch boundaries are machine-managed (do not move entries manually):
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->`
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->`
- After any edit here, run `python scripts/doc_state_sync.py --fix`.
- Archive search: `rg -n "^### 20" docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->

### 2026-07-24 - Batch 21 opened: UI overhaul definition committed (Batch 21 WP-0)

- Scope: opened Batch 21 (UI overhaul -- Tailwind + daisyUI migration)
  on `wip/batch-21`, a worktree off `main` at the PR #162 merge.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` expanded from the stub into the full 9-WP
    definition derived from the owner's Claude Design audit (UI Audit
    v3): toolchain (WP-1), base shell + error-page pilot (WP-2), index
    (WP-3), unified loading (WP-4), results leaderboard (WP-5), heatmap
    seam removal (WP-6), unmatched + reason_code backend fix (WP-7),
    sweep + close-out (WP-8). Strangler migration, page by page.
  - Four owner decisions locked in the definition: rotating loading
    messages cut; welcome modal deleted; `limit_results` kept inside the
    thresholds disclosure; fonts self-hosted under `static/fonts/`.
  - Agent verification recorded in the definition: the unmatched
    reason-string grouping bug is live; `--bs-primary` never overridden;
    `bootstrap.Popover` in `index.js` is a third Bootstrap JS consumer
    the audit missed; `--bars-color` must be aliased in both themes.
  - PLAYBOOK Section 2 row title updated; Section 3 marks Batch 21
    active with next action WP-1; SESSION_CONTEXT rows updated.
  - Toolchain mechanics locked after an owner-relayed Opus 5 review:
    CLI binary in gitignored `scripts/bin/` with `.gitkeep`; auto-fetch
    at a pinned version via a new `scripts/dev/tailwind_build.py` (not
    `dev_start.py` -- app startup never needs the toolchain); WP-8 adds
    a rebuild-and-diff pre-commit hook for compiled-CSS drift; WP-8
    owner E2E explicitly opens the downloaded save-as-image file.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0 (expected
  root warning for the now-active `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md`).
- Forward guidance: WP-1 sets up the Tailwind v4 standalone CLI +
  daisyUI v5 bundled plugin, defines both themes from the audit token
  sheet, and commits the compiled CSS. No template changes until WP-2.

### 2026-08-20 - F-SWE-2 UTC album-year window fixed (Batch 21 WP-0)

- Scope: cleared the only F-SWE-1 migration blocker in the standalone
  prerequisite after WP-0 and before WP-1. No Tailwind or WP-1 work started.
- Plan vs implementation: as planned. `orchestrator.py` now imports
  `timezone` and passes `tzinfo=timezone.utc` to both listening-year boundary
  constructors. The regression drives the public `fetch_top_albums_async`
  workflow, simulates UTC-5 semantics only for naive constructors, and checks
  the literal UTC epoch values sent to the mocked Last.fm boundary. Existing
  mock track fixtures now construct their UTS values in explicit UTC too.
- TDD red evidence: before the production fix,
  `pytest -q tests/services/test_lastfm_logic.py::test_fetch_top_albums_uses_utc_year_window_on_non_utc_host`
  failed twice with the same boundary shift:

  ```text
  AssertionError: expected await not found.
  Expected: mock('testuser', 1704067200, 1735689599, progress_cb=None)
    Actual: mock('testuser', 1704085200, 1735707599, progress_cb=None)
  ```

  After the fix, the targeted test passed, and the complete test module passed
  with 8 tests.
- Deviations: no implementation deviation. Pre-push whole-file review corrected
  the README test badge and module inventory plus two forward-looking WP-7
  claims that still described WP-7 as the first test-count change. The same-day
  docsync source order gives live side-task entries precedence over
  current-batch entries, so the document-map entry below carries a later-count
  addendum that points back to this entry. Its original 590-test completion
  result stays unchanged.
  F-SWE-3 remains P2, F-B21-1 remains P1 without blocking WP-1, and root
  hygiene remains deferred until after WP-1.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **591 passed**, 3 warnings.
  `pre-commit run --all-files` -- all hooks pass; all tracked Markdown hashes
  match before and after the hook. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0 with
  the expected active-root `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` warning.
- Forward guidance: F-SWE-2 is resolved. WP-1 is next; pause for owner review
  of this commit before starting it.

### 2026-08-20 - PR #172 frontend-gate contract made executable (Batch 21 WP-0)

- Scope: addressed the two actionable P1 review threads on the active Batch 21
  definition before WP-1. This is design and state documentation only; no
  frontend runtime or WP-1 work started.
- Verification of the review findings: criterion 9 required the frontend gate
  at every WP while the validation section created it at WP-2, making WP-1
  impossible to complete. The planned Python script also had no declared
  Playwright package, browser provisioning, CI setup, or callable bridge to
  the machine-local MCP providers.
- Plan vs implementation: owner-approved as designed. The three existing
  repository gates remain mandatory at every WP and the frontend gate starts
  at WP-2. That WP pins `playwright==1.62.0` in `requirements-dev.txt`, installs
  its matching Chromium build explicitly on the developer machine and Linux
  CI, runs the repository gate in the Quality Gate, and documents setup in
  README and DEVELOPMENT when the runtime lands. The script owns an ephemeral
  loopback Flask server and always tears it down; missing tooling fails with an
  actionable command rather than downloading silently. No Node project,
  pytest plugin, or MCP dependency is introduced.
- Review disposition outside this commit: the nuanced F-SWE-3 thread received
  the owner-approved ROI explanation and was resolved without expanding WP-7.
  F-SWE-3 remains open at P2; operational Spotify failures do not become an
  unmatched-page `reason_code`.
- Deviations: none. The active definition is the canonical design document, so
  no duplicate `docs/superpowers/specs/` file was created.
- Validation: qualified `pytest -q` -- **591 passed**, 3 warnings; all
  pre-commit hooks passed; tracked-Markdown MD5 manifests were identical
  before and after the hook run; `doc_state_sync.py --check` passed with only
  the expected active-batch root-definition warning.
- Forward guidance: land PR #172, then start WP-1. The Playwright dependency,
  browser download, workflow change, gate implementation, tests, README, and
  DEVELOPMENT updates all land together at WP-2.

### 2026-08-20 - Tailwind and daisyUI toolchain completed (Batch 21 WP-1)

- Scope: added the Node-free pinned Tailwind/daisyUI toolchain, themes,
  committed compiled CSS, and Linux CI rebuild. No templates changed and
  `scripts/dev/dev_start.py` remains unchanged.
- Plan vs implementation: Tailwind v4.3.3 and daisyUI v5.7.19 pin seven
  platform assets -- Windows x64, macOS x64 and arm64, Linux x64 and arm64
  for glibc and musl -- plus `daisyui.mjs` and `daisyui-theme.mjs`. Every
  artifact is SHA-256-verified on every use; one verified atomic replacement
  follows an invalid cache entry. The source restricts daisyUI to button,
  card, modal, toggle, input, select, tab, toast, and alert; it locks the
  reviewed light/dark palette, type scale, 4px spacing ladder, 8/14/999px
  radii, and both `--bars-color` aliases. CI caches `scripts/bin/` by runner
  OS, architecture, and build-script hash.
- TDD evidence: initial collection failed for the missing
  `scripts.dev.tailwind_build` module; cache tests first failed on the absent
  cache interface; source-contract tests first failed on absent
  `static/css/tailwind.src.css`. Focused green commands were
  `pytest tests/scripts/dev/test_tailwind_build.py -q`,
  `pytest tests/scripts/dev/test_tailwind_build_cli.py -q`, and
  `pytest tests/scripts/dev/test_tailwind_build.py tests/scripts/dev/test_tailwind_build_cli.py -q`
  (35 passed).
- Reproducibility: Windows and the `python:3.13-slim` headless glibc-Linux
  probe both produced SHA-256
  `481230ebf858f2fe3b0497c7247be3532917e1c6432cd2bde0940721e81d1b09`.
  The Quality Gate is configured to rebuild with the same Linux x64 asset.
  It has not run yet, because the branch is unpushed.
- Documentation: DEVELOPMENT owns commands; README links rather than copying;
  BATCH21_DEFINITION owns the CI decision; exact pins and digests live in code.
- Deviations: owner-approved fail-closed hardening distinguishes only `None`
  as omitted, so explicit empty platform values cannot probe the live host,
  with deterministic `required_artifacts()` matrix coverage. Same-date
  live-side precedence also required this minimal pointer addendum and the
  deterministic rotation of one older non-current entry; point-in-time history
  was not rewritten. For the four final-review peer-size findings, the owner
  ruled that the cap is flexible when it prevents only files that are
  tremendously out of place or becoming god-files. The plan remains one
  reviewed execution contract, generated `tailwind.css` is indivisible, the
  builder owns one cohesive standard-library toolchain responsibility, and its
  tests stay beside that public seam. None is a god-file or out of place, so
  no split was made and `AGENTS.md` remains unchanged. Final review also
  found both musl pins unreachable: `platform.libc_ver()` reports nothing on
  musl and `libc` on some glibc hosts, so the plan's direct
  `platform.libc_ver()[0]` check gave way to `_normalize_libc()` and
  `_detect_libc()`, which probes for the musl loader. Verified in Docker on
  `python:3.13-alpine` and `python:3.13-slim`. The plan keeps its original
  code listing as the reviewed design.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **633 passed**, 3 warnings. All pre-commit hooks
  passed; tracked-Markdown manifests were identical before and after the hook;
  `doc_state_sync.py --fix` exited 0 with the expected active root-definition
  warning for `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md`.
- Forward guidance: owner review first; the root-hygiene side task is next;
  WP-2 follows it. WP-2 keeps the cache, removes the direct CI build step only
  when its drift hook lands, and adds the first Tailwind-consuming template.

### 2026-08-23 - Base shell, error-page pilot, and two new gates (Batch 21 WP-2)

- Scope: the first Tailwind template. Added the standing header bar, moved
  Bootstrap and `global.css` into a per-page block, migrated `error.html`,
  and built the two gates that protect the rest of the migration.
- Plan vs implementation: the plan is
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-22-batch21-wp2-base-shell.md`, 13 tasks in
  five commits. All 13 landed.
  - The Adobe Fonts reversal was recorded first, then the theme tokens moved
    to kit `rwy8ghw`. `--font-weight-medium` and `--font-weight-semibold`
    were deleted: the kit serves 300, 400 and 700 only, so those two tokens
    could only ever produce a synthesized fake weight.
  - `tailwind-css-drift` rebuilds and diffs on every commit. It sets
    `always_run` and `pass_filenames: false` because the top-level exclude
    filters out `static/`, so a filename-driven hook would never run on the
    one file it exists to check.
  - `scripts/dev/frontend_gate.py` serves the app on a loopback port it owns
    and drives Chromium. Four checks: exactly one framework stylesheet per
    page, `--bars-color` equal to the theme primary with no cool grey left,
    the theme surviving a reload, and all five kit families resolving as
    loaded faces.
  - `base.html` sets `data-theme` before first paint, links the kit, and
    carries the header bar. `theme.js` dual-writes `data-theme` and
    `.dark-mode` until WP-8 retires the second write.
- Deviations, each owner-approved or recorded here:
  - **The legacy CSS block defaults ON.** The plan left it empty and had each
    unmigrated page opt in. The owner inverted it on 2026-08-23, so a
    forgotten template keeps its theme and only a migrated page opts out.
    Forgetting is now safe instead of silently broken.
  - **`templates/inline/scrobble_scope_lockup_inline.svg` is new.** The
    design system reserves the lockup for the header and keeps the full mark
    with tagline for social use. No lockup asset was imported, so this one is
    derived from the existing wordmark by removing the tagline group and
    tightening the viewBox. The letterform paths are unchanged.
  - **`tests/test_template_shell.py` is new and not in the plan.** The plan
    says nothing in `pytest` catches a missed legacy block. Twenty tests now
    do, across all five templates. Emptying the block in `base.html` fails
    eight of them.
  - **The direct CI Tailwind build step was removed** rather than kept beside
    the hook, which is what the batch definition's CI decision says. A digest
    print survives as a separate diagnostic step, because the hook proves
    only that the committed file matches a rebuild on that runner and says
    nothing about Windows against Linux.
  - **`tests/conftest.py` was fixed alongside the gate.** Both used
    `os.environ.setdefault` for `SECRET_KEY`. Actions sets that variable to
    an empty string when the secret is missing, and empty is present, so
    `setdefault` does nothing and the app refuses to boot.
  - **The gate's theme-persistence check runs on a migrated page**, not the
    index, because the welcome modal's backdrop covers the header there.
    Filed as `F-B21-11`; WP-3 deletes that modal.
- Findings: `F-B21-2` and `F-B21-7` resolved, and `F-AUDIT-1` resolved by the
  44px header targets. `F-B21-10` filed -- every error page reports 400
  whatever the real status, and the fix lives in files WP-7 reserves.
  `F-B21-11` filed. Neither is mirrored to a GitHub issue; `F-B21-9` records
  that the mirror is manual.
- Known gap, recorded rather than fixed: the gate's four browser checks have
  no unit coverage, though its runtime does. A check that quietly stops
  asserting looks exactly like a check that passes, so this is worth closing
  with one stub-page assertion each in a later work package.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **666 passed**, 3 warnings. All 11 pre-commit
  hooks pass, and `git write-tree` is identical before and after. The
  frontend gate reports `4 checks passed`, and it was proven able to fail:
  it reported ten real failures before the shell landed.
  `doc_state_sync.py --check` exits 0 with the expected active
  root-definition warning.
- Forward guidance: owner visual review of the error page in both themes
  before WP-3. Do not push the gate commit on its own -- the workflow runs on
  push to `wip/**`, and the gate fails until the shell commit lands with it.
  WP-3 takes the index page, deletes the welcome modal, and adds its page to
  `MIGRATED_PAGES` in the gate.

### 2026-08-25 - Index page migrated to Tailwind (Batch 21 WP-3)

- Scope: rebuilt `index.html` on Tailwind and daisyUI, deleted the welcome
  modal and the `bootstrap.Popover` hints, extracted three Jinja partials,
  and moved the index into every frontend-gate check. WP-6 is absorbed here
  (owner, 2026-08-23): the heatmap has no page of its own, so its form,
  loading panel and result frame all live on this page.
- Plan vs implementation: the plan is
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-23-batch21-wp3-index-page.md`, 16 tasks in
  six commits. All 16 landed, in eleven commits rather than six -- five
  unplanned ones came out of owner visual review and two Codex review
  rounds. That plan's Progress section carries the commit table.
- Deviations, fifteen in total and all listed in the plan. The ones that
  change a contract:
  - **WP-6 absorbed into WP-3.** Its stub heading must keep the words
    "absorbed into" verbatim; `WP_SKIPPED_RE` in DOC007 recognises that
    phrasing and two others, and nothing else.
  - **`limit_results` stays a visible field**, reversing definition
    decision 3. Owner ruled that how many albums you list is not part of
    what counts as listened.
  - **The type stack is Adobe Fonts**, not self-hosted; that reversal
    predates this WP and is recorded in `docs/design/RECONCILIATION.md`.
  - **`/validate_user` is kept** against the design README's simpler
    "more than two characters" rule, because the definition requires
    validation parity.
  - **The heatmap geometry ruling is Claude's**, not the owner's: 14px
    cell, 2px gap desktop and 1px mobile, radius 2px, `--heatmap-empty`
    `#e8e2d6` / `#262230`. It resolves `RECONCILIATION.md` section 7.
  - **The index is full bleed and the hero scales past 1500px**, both past
    the design's stated 560px mark and 42px headline. Owner ruled both
    after seeing 538px of dead space at 1600, 2000 and 2560 alike.
  - **`Save image` is a new feature the plan never scoped**, about 120
    lines drawing a canvas by hand. Owner approved it knowing the labels
    inside the serialized SVG fall back to a plain monospace stack.
  - **Stylesheet units moved to rem** for type and spacing, px kept for
    thin detail. Owner rule, 2026-08-25; `AGENTS.md` "UI and
    Accessibility Rules" item 1 carries it and `RECONCILIATION.md`
    section 11 records why it overrides the design snapshot.
  - **`error.css` and `shell.css` were edited**, though the plan assigns
    them to WP-8 and WP-2. The touch-target check found 40px buttons on
    the error page, and `shell.css` loads on every page so leaving it in
    px put px spacing around rem type on the migrated one.
- The plan's one predicted red never happened. `check_stylesheet_isolation`
  counts framework stylesheets rather than naming which framework a page
  should carry, so a page that swaps one for the other stays green.
- Gates grew with the work. The frontend gate went from four checks at a
  single desktop viewport to eight across three device profiles -- a 1280
  mouse, a 390 touch phone and a 1280 touch screen. Two checks are new:
  touch targets, which drives the page into five states before measuring
  because most controls start hidden, and initial visibility, which asserts
  computed display rather than a class name. A third, validation feedback,
  was added after review found a defect no gate could see.
- Reviews: Codex raised twelve comments across three rounds on PR #218.
  Every one was valid. One was declined on its premise -- it claimed the
  closed thresholds disclosure gave its controls zero-sized boxes, and
  deleting their sizing turns the gate red, so the controls were being
  measured -- and its remedy was applied anyway as insurance.
- Findings: `F-B21-11` and `F-B18-12` resolved. `F-B21-5` updated; its SMIL
  and mode-pill items are resolved. `F-B21-4` item 1 is decided and the
  finding stays open for items 2 to 4. Five filed: `F-B21-14` through
  `F-B21-18`.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **749 passed**, 3 warnings. All 11 pre-commit
  hooks pass with an identical `git write-tree` either side. The frontend
  gate reports `8 checks passed in 13 runs across desktop, mobile, wide
  touch`, and every new check was proved able to fail by mutation.
  `doc_state_sync.py --check` exits 0 with the expected active
  root-definition warning.
- Forward guidance: WP-4 takes `loading.html`. It needs a GET route before
  the gate can see the page it migrates -- `LEGACY_PAGES` is empty because
  the three remaining templates render only from a POST with session state.
  `templates/partials/_loading.html` already exists and is framework-neutral,
  built a work package early; WP-4 consumes it rather than writing one.
  `F-B21-17` proposes the deterministic drift check that would have caught a
  third of this batch's review comments, and the owner approved building it
  after this work package closes.

### 2026-08-26 - Canonical page navigation and routes added (side-task)

- Scope: implemented the owner-requested navigation prerequisite before the
  WP-4 loading rebuild. The shared header now offers Home, Results, Heatmap,
  and Unmatched in Input Mono Narrow, plus the segmented Light/Dark control.
  Loading stays transient and has no navigation pill.
- Plan vs implementation: added canonical `GET /loading`, `/results`,
  `/heatmap`, and `/unmatched` routes. New album jobs redirect to the loading
  URL and the loading script opens the results URL at completion. The old
  completion and unmatched POST routes remain compatibility shims during the
  strangler. Unmatched JSON moved to `GET /api/unmatched` so the page owns
  `/unmatched`.
- Deviations: direct Results and Unmatched visits without a job now render a
  friendly pre-search state with a Home action. Heatmap already falls back to
  its form. The owner renamed the prototype's Index pill to Home and removed
  Loading from the destination set.
- Validation: `pytest -q` **833 passed**, 3 warnings. The frontend gate
  reports 17 checks passed in 25 runs across desktop, mobile, and wide touch.
  JavaScript syntax checks and `doc_state_sync.py --check` pass.
- Forward guidance: WP-4 still owns the unified loading-page rebuild and the
  two pipeline state-machine checks in `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md`. Keep the
  canonical route and compatibility shims until the strangler retires them.

### 2026-08-26 - PR #220 review applied, and the theme fallback proved (side-task)

- Scope: remediated the three Codex comments on PR #220. All three were
  verified against the code before any fix; all three were valid.
- **The missing log entry** is the entry below this one, covering `9330ac8`,
  `ebb542b` and `6f8ff98`.
- **The `FINDINGS.md` header** attributed F-B21-21 and F-B21-22 to both WP-3
  and the owner review while omitting F-B21-23 and F-B21-24. Corrected in
  `12cfe25`.
- **`check_mark_follows_theme` was weak in two ways**, and both are closed. A
  part whose selector stopped matching read as null and was skipped, so
  re-cutting the asset would have retired the check silently. And the test
  was only that light differs from dark, so a wrapper wired to the wrong but
  theme-varying token passed. It now compares each mark against the resolved
  `--shell-ink` and `--shell-accent` for that theme, read through a probe
  element so the browser normalises `#1a1820` and `rgb(26, 24, 32)` to the
  same string. Mutation-checked: pointing the letterforms at
  `var(--shell-accent)` -- a wrong value that does vary by theme, which the
  old check accepted -- fails four times with the token named.
- **The uncommitted `base.html` theme fallback is real, and is now proved.**
  It was written on 2026-08-26 at 00:08 and left uncommitted when that
  session hit its spend limit mid-verification. Its own mutation check had
  passed on both the new and the reverted code, so it proved nothing: the
  harness never made storage actually throw. Rerun with `localStorage`
  genuinely throwing, the shipped version renders `light` on a dark system
  when site data is blocked, and the fix corrects it. A sixteenth gate check,
  `check_theme_survives_blocked_storage`, holds it; reverting the fix fails
  it by name. The check opens its own browser context, because blocked
  storage is installed as an init script and cannot be removed from the
  shared page afterwards.
- This does **not** close F-B21-22. A stored `'false'` still outranks the
  system preference forever; that needs the third state and an owner ruling.
- **A fourth comment arrived on the sweep after `3526edd`, and it was
  right.** The `worktree-alignment` hook shipped gating, documented as
  erroring only on WT002, WT007 and WT014. Eleven of the fifteen codes are
  errors: WT001, WT002, WT003, WT004, WT005, WT006, WT007, WT008, WT012,
  WT014, and WT009 inside a linked worktree. WT003 fires for any branch the
  active batch does not name and WT004 for the identical-tree divergence a
  rebase merge always leaves, so the gating version would have refused every
  commit on a feature branch and every commit after a merge until the branch
  was realigned. The claim came from grepping two of the guard's six modules
  and generalising -- the incomplete sweep the Anti-Pattern Registry names,
  committed inside a finding about mechanisms that hold in one place only.
- **The owner ruled the hook advisory on 2026-08-26.** The guard gained
  `--advisory`, which prints every diagnostic and always exits 0, and the
  hook uses it. The problem being solved was that the guard's output was
  invisible unless somebody ran it, not that commits needed a new gate. A
  test asserts `--advisory` exits 0 on an ERROR while the same run without
  the flag still exits 1; removing the short-circuit fails it.
- **F-B21-18 is scheduled**, by owner ruling the same day: the JavaScript
  unit-test seam becomes a work package of its own, sequenced before WP-5 and
  not folded into WP-4, scoped to the pure-function half on the existing
  Chromium. WP-5 and WP-7 are the remaining JavaScript-heavy pages, so a seam
  before WP-5 still guards work this batch does. The number it takes needs
  settling against DOC007 and the absorbed WP-6 before its first commit.
- **DOC012 is new, and it exists because this entry nearly lied.** The count
  authority reads `**823 passed**` and nothing else: written without the
  asterisks, the entry records nothing, an older entry stays authoritative,
  and `--check` exits 0 with every dashboard holding the previous number.
  That happened here -- the count was written unbolded, the figure did not
  move, and the gate stayed green. The owner ruled that bolding the line was
  the wrong fix, because the next agent will make the same mistake. DOC012
  now fails an execution-log entry that claims a pass result with no bold
  count anywhere in it. It is scoped per entry, not per line, so a subset
  claim beside a bold figure -- WP-1's "(35 passed)" for the toolchain
  module -- stays prose and history is not rewritten. Mutation-checked in
  both directions: neutering the check fails the first test, dropping the
  entry-scoping fails the second.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **826 passed**, all 12 hooks, docsync exit 0,
  frontend gate 17 checks in 25 runs. The suite grew by four: the
  `--advisory` exit contract and three DOC012 cases.

### 2026-08-26 - Deployed-merge review: wordmark theme fix and doc trim (side-task)

- Scope: the owner reviewed the deployed PR #218 merge and found two defects.
  This entry covers `9330ac8`, `ebb542b` and `6f8ff98`, which shipped without
  one. A PR #220 reviewer raised the omission; the entry is written here
  rather than by amending pushed commits.
- `9330ac8` trimmed the documents a session bootstraps from. SESSION_CONTEXT
  lost 35 lines: eight "Batch N complete" rows that restated the Section 2
  index one batch at a time, and a per-file test table that duplicated forty
  counts from the suite while only the total was gated. It had drifted three
  times during Batch 21, each drift a false fact in a bootstrap document, so
  the command that derives it replaced the table. Two `AGENTS.md` rules were
  restated as intent. AGENT_NOTES gained the wordmark typeface, Oblong
  Regular by WAPType, which took the owner about three hours to recover
  because the mark was converted to paths and no font reference survives in
  the asset. F-B21-21 and F-B21-22 were filed.
- `ebb542b` fixed F-B21-21. The index hero mark shipped with pure black
  letterforms on the `#0e0c12` dark page. Both wrappers include the same
  asset; it pins its own stroke and gives the letterforms no fill rule, so
  any wrapper `shell.css` does not name renders fixed-purple bars and
  user-agent black text, and only `.site-header__mark` was named. The gate
  gained its first check that reads a colour off an inline SVG.
- `6f8ff98` filed F-B21-23 and F-B21-24. F-B21-23 records that the assets
  diverge from the design contract, which specifies `currentColor`
  letterforms and `var(--bars-color)` bars; that divergence is the real
  cause of F-B21-21, which was fixed at the symptom. F-B21-24 rules that the
  index not growing past about 1400px is the contract working as written.
- Validation at the time: 822 tests, all hooks, docsync exit 0, and the
  Quality Gate green on `6f8ff98`.

### 2026-08-26 - Session-time enforcement added after the worktree retirement (side-task)

- Scope: the batch-21 worktree was retired on 2026-08-26. Reviewing how that
  went found that every gate in this repository runs at commit time and
  nothing runs at session time. Filed as F-B21-25 and partly closed here.
- What happened, from the branch reflog. `wip/batch21-doc-trim` was created
  from `origin/main` at 2026-08-25 21:57, took three commits, and was renamed
  to `wip/batch-21` at 2026-08-26 00:07. The rename only succeeds when the
  retained branch of that name is already deleted, and the push four seconds
  later replaced the remote. None of the three commits carried a Section 4
  entry, because the session treated the branch as a quick documentation trim
  rather than batch work, and nothing told it otherwise. A PR #220 reviewer
  raised it; the entry two above this one now covers that work.
- What changed:
  - **`worktree-alignment` is now a pre-commit hook.** The guard already
    exited 1 on an ERROR diagnostic and 0 otherwise, so it was built to gate
    and was simply never wired to one. Only WT002, WT007 and WT014 are
    errors; WT004 and WT010 are not, so the identical-tree state a rebase
    merge always leaves, and a dirty tree, both still commit. It runs verbose
    so branch lineage is visible on a passing run.
  - **The stray `venv/` is deleted.** It carried black 25.1.0 against the
    24.3.0 this repository pins, and two entries in the local permission
    allowlist had been authorising it. Both entries are removed. It came from
    the Batch 12/13 convention, which spelled the directory without the dot;
    the archived definitions still show that spelling, so reading one can
    recreate it. `resolve_venv()` looks only for `.venv` and cannot see a
    second one.
  - **A `SessionStart` hook** injects branch, working-tree state, guard codes
    and the machine-managed status block into every new Claude Code session,
    with the reminder that a tracked-file commit needs its Section 4 entry in
    the same commit. It is local to this machine and does not help Codex or
    Copilot, which is recorded in the finding.
  - **The `FINDINGS.md` header is corrected.** It attributed F-B21-21 and
    F-B21-22 to both WP-3 and the owner review, and omitted F-B21-23 and
    F-B21-24. Raised on PR #220.
- Not done, and deliberately: a manifest of untracked-but-essential files
  (`skills-lock.json` is still missing), and two structural defects in
  `AGENTS.md` -- the fast-paths that authorise skipping bootstrap sit above
  the numbered list, and the file carries origin narrative that serves the
  editor rather than the reader. Both edit `AGENTS.md` and need an owner
  ruling first.
- **The first push went red, and the hook was the cause.** `12cfe25` failed
  the Quality Gate with `ERROR WT007 origin/main -- comparison base ref is
  missing`. `actions/checkout` makes a shallow single-branch clone, so
  `origin/main` does not exist on a runner and the guard fails closed on a
  base ref that is legitimately absent. `WARNING WT009` also fired for the
  `.venv` CI does not use. The step now sets `SKIP: worktree-alignment`,
  with the reason at the step: the guard measures developer worktree
  lineage, and a runner has no worktree topology to protect. Fetching the
  base ref would have silenced WT007 and left the check measuring nothing.
- The lesson is the one this entry is about, applied to its own author. A
  check was added without asking where it runs, and its assumptions held on
  one machine only. Local verification passed and proved nothing about CI.
- Validation: 822 tests, all 12 hooks locally, docsync `--check` exit 0,
  guard exit 0, and the Quality Gate green after the skip landed.
