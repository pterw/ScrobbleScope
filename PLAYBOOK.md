# ScrobbleScope Execution Playbook

Date: 2026-02-22
Purpose: Single source of truth for work sequencing and execution history.
Rules for agent behaviour live in `AGENTS.md`; current-state snapshot in
`.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. Why this document exists

- Provide a single source of truth for work sequencing.
- Enable continuation by another agent with minimal context loss.
- Prevent risky refactor-first changes before parity tests exist.

**Implementation principles:**
1. Approval tests before structural refactor.
2. No behavior-breaking refactors without parity checks.
3. Add observability before optimization where possible.
4. Keep changes batch-scoped and reversible.
5. Keep security-safe rendering (`tojson`, escaping) as baseline.

## 2. Batch order (strict sequence)

Completed batch definitions are archived individually under `docs/history/`.

Close-out entries for each batch currently live in the monolith archive,
not the per-batch log (see FINDINGS F-DOCSYNC-3).

### Open decisions (owner confirmation needed)

1. Persistent store choice: Postgres only or Postgres + Redis.
2. Retry UX policy: immediate retry button only, or retry + cooldown messaging.
3. Error copy style and user-facing tone for upstream failures.

## 3. Active batch + next action

- **Batch 18 is complete.** All 5 WPs done. Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH18_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 19 is complete.** All 5 WPs done plus owner-review follow-up.
  Definition archived: `docs/history/definitions/BATCH19_DEFINITION.md`.
  PR #152 (Batches 18 + 19) merged to `main`.
- **Batch 20 is complete.** All 9 WPs done (WP-0 through WP-5 via PR #159
  on `file-hygeine`; audit gap-fix follow-up, WP-6, WP-7, and WP-8 on
  `wip/batch-20`, submitted as PR #162). Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH20_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 21 is active.** Definition: `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` (repo
  root). Scope: UI overhaul -- Bootstrap 5.1.3 -> Tailwind v4 (standalone
  CLI) + daisyUI v5, warm heatmap-derived themes propagated app-wide,
  page-by-page strangler migration. Expanded from the owner's Claude
  Design audit (UI Audit v3); four owner decisions locked in the
  definition. Branch: `wip/batch-21` (worktree off `main`).
- **Next action:** Batch 21 WP-1 (Tailwind + daisyUI toolchain and theme
  tokens; no template changes).
- Batch 21 WP status: WP-0 done. WP-1 through WP-8 not yet started.
- **Perf note:** heatmap fetch speed is rate-limit bound; measurement and
  rationale live in FINDINGS.md F-B18-11 (single source).
- **Last.timer note (checked 2026-05-19):** the referenced project uses
  aggregate `user.gettopartists`/`user.gettoptracks` calls with page fan-out,
  not exact per-scrobble recent-track timestamps. Useful for future perf
  research, but not a drop-in heatmap speedup. See FINDINGS.md F-B19-3.
- Future feature candidates (confirmed by owner roadmap):
  - **Top songs** (future): rank most-played tracks for a year (Last.fm + possibly
    Spotify enrichment, separate background task + loading/results flow).

## 4. Execution log (for agent handoff)

Keep only the active window here: current batch entries plus the latest 4
non-current operational logs. Older dated entries live in
`docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.

**How to read dated entries:**
- Each heading `YYYY-MM-DD - ...` is a completion/addendum log.
- Untagged side-task history: `docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Tagged batch history: per-batch logs under `docs/history/logs/`.
- Batch scope/acceptance criteria: definitions under `docs/history/definitions/`.
- Current-batch boundaries are machine-managed (do not move entries manually):
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->`
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->`
- After any edit here, run `python scripts/doc_state_sync.py --fix`.
- Archive search: `rg -n "^### 20" docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->

### 2026-07-24 - Batch 21 opened: UI overhaul definition committed (Batch 21 WP-0)

- Scope: opened Batch 21 (UI overhaul -- Tailwind + daisyUI migration)
  on `wip/batch-21`, a worktree off `main` at the PR #162 merge.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` expanded from the stub into the full 9-WP
    definition derived from the owner's Claude Design audit (UI Audit
    v3): toolchain (WP-1), base shell + error-page pilot (WP-2), index
    (WP-3), unified loading (WP-4), results leaderboard (WP-5), heatmap
    seam removal (WP-6), unmatched + reason_code backend fix (WP-7),
    sweep + close-out (WP-8). Strangler migration, page by page.
  - Four owner decisions locked in the definition: rotating loading
    messages cut; welcome modal deleted; `limit_results` kept inside the
    thresholds disclosure; fonts self-hosted under `static/fonts/`.
  - Agent verification recorded in the definition: the unmatched
    reason-string grouping bug is live; `--bs-primary` never overridden;
    `bootstrap.Popover` in `index.js` is a third Bootstrap JS consumer
    the audit missed; `--bars-color` must be aliased in both themes.
  - PLAYBOOK Section 2 row title updated; Section 3 marks Batch 21
    active with next action WP-1; SESSION_CONTEXT rows updated.
  - Toolchain mechanics locked after an owner-relayed Opus 5 review:
    CLI binary in gitignored `scripts/bin/` with `.gitkeep`; auto-fetch
    at a pinned version via a new `scripts/dev/tailwind_build.py` (not
    `dev_start.py` -- app startup never needs the toolchain); WP-8 adds
    a rebuild-and-diff pre-commit hook for compiled-CSS drift; WP-8
    owner E2E explicitly opens the downloaded save-as-image file.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0 (expected
  root warning for the now-active `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md`).
- Forward guidance: WP-1 sets up the Tailwind v4 standalone CLI +
  daisyUI v5 bundled plugin, defines both themes from the audit token
  sheet, and commits the compiled CSS. No template changes until WP-2.

### 2026-07-31 - PR #165 Copilot review round 4 (side-task)

- Scope: zero visible comments, two suppressed, both valid and both real
  defects rather than the judgement-call trade-offs round 3 predicted.
  The convergence call made after round 3 was wrong; recorded here
  because the wrong prediction is the useful part. Tally 18/18.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - **A rule was silently deleted by this PR, and round 1 removed the
    last copy.** The prohibition on `git add -A` / `git add .` lived in
    two places before this branch: AGENT_NOTES.md Owner Preferences and
    the old HANDOFF_PROMPT anti-pattern list. The PR's HANDOFF_PROMPT
    rewrite dropped its copy, and the round-1 dedup replaced the
    AGENT_NOTES copy with a pointer to AGENTS.md Commit Rules -- which
    never contained the prohibition. Step 5 only said "stage only files
    changed for this work package", which `git add -A` can satisfy when
    every changed file happens to belong to the WP. Restored explicitly
    in Commit Rules step 5, the canonical location the pointer targets.
  - Lesson: verifying that a pointer's target "covers it in substance"
    is not enough. Round 1 checked AGENTS.md:167 and accepted a
    paraphrase as equivalent when it dropped a prohibition. Before
    deleting a rule copy, diff the *specific obligations*, not the topic.
  - `scripts/testing/concurrent_users_test.py` promised queuing in three
    places. `acquire_job_slot()` uses `acquire(blocking=False)` and both
    call sites (`routes.py:460`, `routes.py:570`) return an error
    immediately, so excess submissions are rejected and never queued.
    Round 1 edited one of those lines for the cap change without
    questioning the surrounding claim. Now describes rejection, matching
    README's "capacity rejections" wording.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all 10 hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.
- Forward guidance: do not call convergence from the *shape* of a round's
  findings. Rounds 2 and 3 returned zero visible comments and were still
  productive; round 4 found a deleted rule. Stop when a round returns
  nothing, not when the findings look minor.

### 2026-07-31 - PR #165 Copilot review round 3 (side-task)

- Scope: round 3 again returned zero visible comments and three
  suppressed ones. Two acted on in full, one acted on in part.
  Suppressed-block tally now 16/16 across #163, #164, and #165.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `docs/SWE_AUDIT_CHARTER.md` Section 3 copied the ten principle names
    from AGENT_NOTES.md and **had already drifted**: the copy dropped the
    definitions for Dependency Inversion, Least Knowledge, and Fail Fast,
    and truncated SRP from "single responsibility per module/function".
    This is the rare case where the drift was demonstrable rather than
    hypothetical, so the copy is gone. The section now points at
    AGENT_NOTES.md and keeps only the two audit-specific methods (Clean
    Architecture via the SESSION_CONTEXT Section 4 acyclic graph, Boy
    Scout via git history).
  - `docs/SWE_AUDIT_CHARTER.md` Section 6 restated side-task entry
    placement that AGENTS.md Side-Task Handling owns -- and round 2 had
    just renumbered that section, so the charter was already a rewrite
    away from being wrong. Delegated.
  - `HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` Section 1 restated the bootstrap-conflict rule
    verbatim from AGENTS.md:64-65 inside a paragraph that claims rules
    "are not restated here". Removed.
- Deviations: **partially declined** the reviewer's request to also strip
  "Do not push without owner instruction" from the charter's commit step.
  Verified AGENTS.md:171 owns it, so the SSOT argument is technically
  right, but that line sits at the point of action for a cold-start
  executor (the charter is written so Codex can run it without prior
  context) and a push is not reversible. Deliberate safety redundancy is
  worth one line. Removed the same sentence from HANDOFF_PROMPT Section 1
  by contrast, because there the reader is being sent to AGENTS.md in the
  very same paragraph, so the copy buys nothing.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all 10 hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.
- Forward guidance: watch for diminishing returns. Rounds 1-3 were all
  genuine, but the remaining duplication is increasingly load-bearing
  context for cold-start executors; judge each on whether the copy can
  drift *and* whether losing it costs a reader who cannot see the source.
  Batch 21 WP-1 remains the next action.

### 2026-07-31 - PR #165 Copilot review round 2 (side-task)

- Scope: round 2 returned **zero visible comments and five suppressed
  ones**. All five were valid. The suppressed-block hit rate is now 13/13
  across PRs #163, #164, and #165 while the visible stream has gone dry
  twice; treat that block as the primary signal, not an appendix.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `AGENTS.md` Side-Task Handling read as an ordered procedure whose
    step 1 was "commit" and step 2 "add the log entry", contradicting
    Commit Rules step 4 and Anti-Pattern Registry #9, which require the
    entry to be in the same commit. Since AGENTS.md is now the rules
    SSOT, an internal contradiction there is load-bearing. Reworded so
    side-tasks inherit the commit rules unchanged and differ only in
    entry placement and tagging; the remaining steps renumbered.
  - `HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` Section 5 told agents to document completion
    *after* committing and to commit the docs separately -- the same
    conflict, one level down. Now states that docs land in the commit.
  - Resolution was evidence-based, not a judgement call: registry #9
    forbids a commit without its entry, and all four recent side-task
    commits (`2559f39`, `2b9b095`, `98cc50c`, `900d0e6`) bundle
    PLAYBOOK + archive with the change. Docs were wrong; practice was
    right.
  - `FINDINGS.md` F-LOAD-1 proposed an "N/5 slots in use" hint, which
    hard-codes a value that is env-configurable. This PR had changed it
    from "N/10" -- swapping one literal for another. Now specifies
    reading the cap from `MAX_ACTIVE_JOBS` at render time.
  - `.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` header said 2026-07-28 while the body
    recorded a 2026-07-31 runtime change. Header updated.
  - `docs/SWE_AUDIT_CHARTER.md` cited "AGENTS.md registry #10" for
    silent scope reduction; #10 is about re-measuring canonical figures
    and says nothing about audit coverage. The charter was added in this
    PR, so this was a sourcing error at write time, not staleness --
    corrected rather than left as a point-in-time record. Now states the
    requirement directly.
- Deviations: round 1 split its fixes across two commits, and `07c4f5b`
  therefore landed without its own Section 4 entry -- a violation of
  Anti-Pattern Registry #9, the rule this round clarifies. Not rewritten:
  both commits were already pushed and history rewrites need owner
  instruction. Round 2 is a single commit. Standing lesson: this repo's
  #9 outranks the generic "prefer small atomic commits" heuristic, and
  the one-commit-per-review-round precedent from PR #163 was correct.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all 10 hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.
- Forward guidance: Batch 21 WP-1 remains the next action. `gh` writes
  are still unavailable this session, so the round-2 reply is unposted.

### 2026-07-31 - PR #165 Copilot review round 1 (side-task)

- Scope: triaged the five comments on PR #165 (four inline, one inside
  the suppressed low-confidence block). All five were valid; none were
  declined. Two themes: an overstated concurrency claim and three
  leftover copies of rules AGENTS.md now owns.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `config.py`: the MAX_ACTIVE_JOBS rationale claimed a cap of 5 "keeps
    >=2 req/s per job". `_GlobalThrottle.next_wait()` (utils.py) advances
    a single next-allowed timestamp under one lock, serializing callers
    in arrival order with no per-job accounting, so a busy job can take
    more slots than an idle one. Reworded as an average, matching the
    "~10/N req/s" framing already used in AGENT_NOTES.md.
  - `scripts/testing/concurrent_users_test.py`: module docstring and
    `build_parser()` still said the default was 10 and told operators to
    set `--concurrency` above 10. Both now say 5. A repo-wide sweep found
    no other live stale reference; remaining "default 10" hits are all
    under `docs/history/` and stay as written (point-in-time records).
  - `AGENT_NOTES.md`: the Owner Preferences commit-mechanics bullet and
    the Venv "In short:" line each pointed at AGENTS.md and then restated
    its content anyway. Both reduced to pointers after verifying AGENTS.md
    genuinely carries every rule involved.
  - `HANDOFF_PROMPT.md`: Section 2 restated the full three-command gate
    and the root-BATCH warning, contradicting the Document Roles contract
    added by this same PR, which assigns gates to AGENTS.md. Collapsed to
    a pointer matching the wording Sections 3 and 4 already use.
- Deviations: none. No test changes -- all five edits are comment or
  documentation text with no behavior change.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all 10 hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.
- Forward guidance: the suppressed-comment block again held a real
  finding (8/8 across PRs #163/#164/#165), so keep expanding it. Batch 21
  WP-1 remains the next action.
