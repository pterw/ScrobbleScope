# ScrobbleScope Execution Playbook

Date: 2026-02-22
Purpose: Single source of truth for work sequencing and execution history.
Rules for agent behaviour live in `AGENTS.md`; current-state snapshot in
`.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. Why this document exists

- Provide a single source of truth for work sequencing.
- Enable continuation by another agent with minimal context loss.
- Prevent risky refactor-first changes before parity tests exist.

**Implementation principles:**
1. Approval tests before structural refactor.
2. No behavior-breaking refactors without parity checks.
3. Add observability before optimization where possible.
4. Keep changes batch-scoped and reversible.
5. Keep security-safe rendering (`tojson`, escaping) as baseline.

## 2. Batch order (strict sequence)

Completed batch definitions are archived individually under `docs/history/`.

### Open decisions (owner confirmation needed)

1. Persistent store choice: Postgres only or Postgres + Redis.
2. Retry UX policy: immediate retry button only, or retry + cooldown messaging.
3. Error copy style and user-facing tone for upstream failures.

## 3. Active batch + next action

- **Batch 18 is complete.** All 5 WPs done. Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH18_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 19 is complete.** All 5 WPs done plus owner-review follow-up.
  Definition archived: `docs/history/definitions/BATCH19_DEFINITION.md`.
  PR #152 (Batches 18 + 19) merged to `main`.
- **Batch 20 is complete.** All 9 WPs done (WP-0 through WP-5 via PR #159
  on `file-hygeine`; audit gap-fix follow-up, WP-6, WP-7, and WP-8 on
  `wip/batch-20`, submitted as PR #162). Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH20_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 21 is active.** Definition: `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` (repo
  root). Scope: UI overhaul -- Bootstrap 5.1.3 -> Tailwind v4 (standalone
  CLI) + daisyUI v5, warm heatmap-derived themes propagated app-wide,
  page-by-page strangler migration. Expanded from the owner's Claude
  Design audit (UI Audit v3); four owner decisions locked in the
  definition. Branch: `wip/batch-21` (worktree off `main`).
- **Next action:** Batch 21 WP-1 (Tailwind + daisyUI toolchain and theme
  tokens; no template changes).
- Batch 21 WP status: WP-0 done. WP-1 through WP-8 not yet started.
- **Perf note:** heatmap fetch speed is rate-limit bound; measurement and
  rationale live in FINDINGS.md F-B18-11 (single source).
- **Last.timer note (checked 2026-05-19):** the referenced project uses
  aggregate `user.gettopartists`/`user.gettoptracks` calls with page fan-out,
  not exact per-scrobble recent-track timestamps. Useful for future perf
  research, but not a drop-in heatmap speedup. See FINDINGS.md F-B19-3.
- Future feature candidates (confirmed by owner roadmap):
  - **Top songs** (future): rank most-played tracks for a year (Last.fm + possibly
    Spotify enrichment, separate background task + loading/results flow).

## 4. Execution log (for agent handoff)

Keep only the active window here: current batch entries plus the latest 4
non-current operational logs. Older dated entries live in
`docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.

**How to read dated entries:**
- Each heading `YYYY-MM-DD - ...` is a completion/addendum log.
- Untagged side-task history: `docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Tagged batch history: per-batch logs under `docs/history/logs/`.
- Batch scope/acceptance criteria: definitions under `docs/history/definitions/`.
- Current-batch boundaries are machine-managed (do not move entries manually):
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->`
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->`
- After any edit here, run `python scripts/doc_state_sync.py --fix`.
- Archive search: `rg -n "^### 20" docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->

### 2026-07-24 - Batch 21 opened: UI overhaul definition committed (Batch 21 WP-0)

- Scope: opened Batch 21 (UI overhaul -- Tailwind + daisyUI migration)
  on `wip/batch-21`, a worktree off `main` at the PR #162 merge.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` expanded from the stub into the full 9-WP
    definition derived from the owner's Claude Design audit (UI Audit
    v3): toolchain (WP-1), base shell + error-page pilot (WP-2), index
    (WP-3), unified loading (WP-4), results leaderboard (WP-5), heatmap
    seam removal (WP-6), unmatched + reason_code backend fix (WP-7),
    sweep + close-out (WP-8). Strangler migration, page by page.
  - Four owner decisions locked in the definition: rotating loading
    messages cut; welcome modal deleted; `limit_results` kept inside the
    thresholds disclosure; fonts self-hosted under `static/fonts/`.
  - Agent verification recorded in the definition: the unmatched
    reason-string grouping bug is live; `--bs-primary` never overridden;
    `bootstrap.Popover` in `index.js` is a third Bootstrap JS consumer
    the audit missed; `--bars-color` must be aliased in both themes.
  - PLAYBOOK Section 2 row title updated; Section 3 marks Batch 21
    active with next action WP-1; SESSION_CONTEXT rows updated.
  - Toolchain mechanics locked after an owner-relayed Opus 5 review:
    CLI binary in gitignored `scripts/bin/` with `.gitkeep`; auto-fetch
    at a pinned version via a new `scripts/dev/tailwind_build.py` (not
    `dev_start.py` -- app startup never needs the toolchain); WP-8 adds
    a rebuild-and-diff pre-commit hook for compiled-CSS drift; WP-8
    owner E2E explicitly opens the downloaded save-as-image file.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0 (expected
  root warning for the now-active `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md`).
- Forward guidance: WP-1 sets up the Tailwind v4 standalone CLI +
  daisyUI v5 bundled plugin, defines both themes from the audit token
  sheet, and commits the compiled CSS. No template changes until WP-2.

### 2026-08-01 - PR #165 review round 6; self-inflicted-drift anti-pattern (side-task)

- Scope: round 6 returned three suppressed comments, zero visible. All
  three verified valid -- and all three were created by round 5's own
  fixes, which is the finding that matters more than the fixes.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - Acted: `AGENTS.md` Side-Task Handling and `HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` both
    cited "Commit Rules step 4" for the documentation requirement; the
    round-5 reorder moved it to step 1. Repointed **by name** ("the
    documentation step", "Missing log entries") rather than by number,
    so a future reorder cannot re-stale them.
  - Acted: `AGENT_NOTES.md` load-testing bullet still asserted the
    per-job guarantee and single-throttle model that round 5 corrected
    in `config.py`. Rewritten to match and to point at `config.py` as
    the single owner of the rationale.
  - Declined (precedent): PLAYBOOK Section 4 entries at :163 and :262
    also contain "step 3/4/6" references that no longer match the
    current numbering. They are dated point-in-time records of what was
    true when written; retro-editing rotated log content was declined
    and accepted in PR #162 round 3 and PR #163 round 3.
  - Root-cause fix: new Anti-Pattern Registry entry 11, "Fixing the
    instance instead of the class" -- requires a blast-radius grep
    before the gates (references to anything renumbered/renamed, and
    sibling copies of any corrected claim), and prefers name-based
    cross-references over numeric ones.
  - Swept beyond the three findings: verified the remaining numeric
    references (`AGENTS.md` close-out step 2, charter bootstrap step 1)
    still resolve correctly, and that the `req/s` claims in F-B18-11 and
    F-B18-10 are accurate because the heatmap and album pipelines are
    both Last.fm-only.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.
- Forward guidance: pushed under the standing review-fix exception with
  a batched reply.

### 2026-08-01 - PR #165 Copilot review round 5 (side-task)

- Scope: round 5 returned "not ready to approve" with four suppressed
  comments and zero visible ones. All four verified valid against the
  code; all four acted on.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `config.py`: the MAX_ACTIVE_JOBS rationale claimed "one global
    10 req/s API throttle". Wrong -- `utils.py:81-82` builds separate
    `_LASTFM_THROTTLE` and `_SPOTIFY_THROTTLE`. Comment now names the
    Last.fm scrobble-fetch phase as the binding constraint.
  - `AGENTS.md` commit procedure: the docsync `--check` gate sat at
    step 3 while the PLAYBOOK update was step 4, so the gate ran before
    the documentation it validates (and `pre-commit` carries the
    `doc-state-sync-check` hook). Reordered: write docs, `--fix`, then
    the three gates on the final state. This matches what sessions
    already do in practice; only the written rule was wrong. Fixed a
    duplicate step number introduced by the renumber.
  - `FINDINGS.md` F-DATA-1 open question 2 proposed grouping
    `spotify_cache` by `artist_norm + album_norm` -- which is the
    primary key (`init_db.py:42`), so every group holds exactly one row
    and the upsert has already overwritten any rival date. Replaced
    with the two methods that can actually work (re-run the Spotify
    search and compare against the earliest fresh candidate, or
    cross-check MusicBrainz).
  - `docs/SWE_AUDIT_CHARTER.md`: prescribed commit subject was a noun
    phrase, violating the imperative-subject rule the charter tells
    executors to follow. Now imperative.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.
- Forward guidance: pushed under the standing review-fix exception with
  a batched reply. PR #165 remains merge-ready pending the next
  auto-review.

### 2026-07-31 - FINDINGS: record reissue cache-key collapse (side-task)

- Scope: capture a data-quality mechanism found while discussing the
  DEVELOPMENT.md rewrite, before the reasoning was lost to chat. No code
  change -- this is a finding, not a fix.
- Plan vs implementation: added `F-DATA-1` under P2.
  `normalize_name()` strips `deluxe`/`edition`/`remastered` and eight
  more words, so a reissue and its original normalize identically; since
  the `spotify_cache` PK is `artist_norm + album_norm`, they share one
  row and whichever populated it first serves its `release_date` for 30
  days. Owner observed this with Viagra Boys "viagr aboys" (2025)
  surfacing under 2026 via the JP deluxe released 2026-01-09, on an
  account that never played it.
- The finding records why the collapse is nonetheless correct (Last.fm
  scrobbles the same record under inconsistent album strings; keying
  editions apart would split one album into several leaderboard rows
  with divided playcounts), the candidate fix (decouple counting from
  dating -- keep the collapse for aggregation, take the *earliest*
  candidate release date when resolving the year, no schema change), the
  rejected boolean discriminator and why, three questions answerable by
  querying the cache, and the note that Spotify exposes no
  original-release-date field at all.
- Deviations: earlier in the session an agent claim that release-date
  drift was a systemic risk was walked back. The owner has ~14 years of
  scrobbles and one recalled instance; the claim had been reasoned from
  a plausible mechanism rather than measured. Filed P2 with low user
  impact stated explicitly, and `release_scope: all` already bypasses
  date filtering. Recording the correction so the finding is not read as
  more urgent than the evidence supports.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all 10 hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.
- Forward guidance: question 2 (which other albums) is a cache query, not
  an investigation -- run it before designing any fix. Sequenced behind
  Batch 21, the F-B20-2 orchestrator split, and the test/docstring pass
  per owner priority.

### 2026-07-31 - DEVELOPMENT.md: correct HANDOFF_PROMPT description (side-task)

- Scope: DEVELOPMENT.md described `HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` as a condensed
  checklist of rules, gates, read order, and commit discipline. That was
  accurate until this branch, which reduced the file to post-read
  verification plus the handoff checklist and replaced everything else
  with pointers. The description was left describing the architecture
  this PR removed.
- Plan vs implementation: two passages corrected -- the architecture
  overview and the per-file section, which was also retitled from
  "Bootstrap Procedure" to "Session Start and Handoff" to match what the
  file now contains. Both now state why the summaries were removed
  (each restatement drifted from its source), which is the reasoning the
  rest of the document uses.
- Deviations: scope-limited on purpose. Only the passages this branch
  made wrong were touched. DEVELOPMENT.md has other known staleness --
  the `gemini-pr-triage` skill is now `pr-bot-triage`, the
  review-suggestions section predates repo-aware review tooling, and the
  closing paragraph needs a rewrite -- all deferred to a post-merge
  documentation pass, per the same in-scope test applied to
  `concurrent_users_test.py` in review round 1.
- Note: this class of staleness is invisible to diff-scoped review.
  Copilot reported "13/13 changed files" across four rounds and
  DEVELOPMENT.md was never among them, so a file made wrong by the diff
  but not part of it cannot be flagged. Worth remembering when relying on
  automated review for consistency.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all 10 hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0.
- Forward guidance: the post-merge pass should reframe the review section
  around how the tooling changed rather than around rejection, and
  `README.md:492` must move with it -- it currently promises a section on
  suggestions "evaluated and rejected".
