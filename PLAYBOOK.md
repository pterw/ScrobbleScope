# ScrobbleScope Execution Playbook

Date: 2026-02-22
Purpose: Single source of truth for work sequencing and execution history.
Rules for agent behaviour live in `AGENTS.md`; current-state snapshot in
`.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. Why this document exists

- Provide a single source of truth for work sequencing.
- Enable continuation by another agent with minimal context loss.
- Prevent risky refactor-first changes before parity tests exist.

**Implementation principles:**
1. Approval tests before structural refactor.
2. No behavior-breaking refactors without parity checks.
3. Add observability before optimization where possible.
4. Keep changes batch-scoped and reversible.
5. Keep security-safe rendering (`tojson`, escaping) as baseline.

## 2. Batch order (strict sequence)

Completed batch definitions are archived individually under `docs/history/`.

### Batch index (completed batches archived; the active batch, if any, is listed last)

A batch's close-out entry sits in its per-batch log only when the heading
carried a `(Batch N WP-X)` tag (as Batch 18's did). Close-outs tagged
`(Batch N close-out)` are not parser-recognized and were routed to the
monolith archive instead -- Batches 19 and 20 are the current examples.
See FINDINGS F-DOCSYNC-3.

### Open decisions (owner confirmation needed)

1. Persistent store choice: Postgres only or Postgres + Redis.
2. Retry UX policy: immediate retry button only, or retry + cooldown messaging.
3. Error copy style and user-facing tone for upstream failures.

## 3. Active batch + next action

- **Batch 18 is complete.** All 5 WPs done. Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH18_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 19 is complete.** All 5 WPs done plus owner-review follow-up.
  Definition archived: `docs/history/definitions/BATCH19_DEFINITION.md`.
  PR #152 (Batches 18 + 19) merged to `main`.
- **Batch 20 is complete.** All 9 WPs done (WP-0 through WP-5 via PR #159
  on `file-hygeine`; audit gap-fix follow-up, WP-6, WP-7, and WP-8 on
  `wip/batch-20`, submitted as PR #162). Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH20_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 21 is active.** Definition: `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` (repo
  root). Scope: UI overhaul -- Bootstrap 5.1.3 -> Tailwind v4 (standalone
  CLI) + daisyUI v5, warm heatmap-derived themes propagated app-wide,
  page-by-page strangler migration. Expanded from the owner's Claude
  Design audit (UI Audit v3); four owner decisions locked in the
  definition. Branch: `wip/batch-21` (worktree off `main`).
- **Next action:** WP-1 is complete and awaiting owner review of its single
  commit. The root-hygiene side task is **closed**: the owner rejected the
  audience-banner scheme on 2026-08-20, and the config-file verdict landed in
  `DEPLOY.md`. **WP-2 is next.** It owns the base shell, error-page pilot,
  Playwright runtime, frontend gate, and compiled-CSS pre-commit hook, and it
  closes the three seams filed as F-B21-2.
  Earlier context, still true: **PR #171 merged to `main` on 2026-08-19**
  (`bb187ae`, rebase merge) with zero unresolved review threads after eight
  rounds; `wip/batch-21` was realigned to it. `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` was
  amended the same day so the batch gate can fail on frontend work.
  PR #169 merged 2026-08-08 shipping the
  repository-integrity gate and read-only worktree guard, resolving
  F-DOCSYNC-5/F-WORKTREE-1/F-WORKTREE-2; three guard files exceed their
  directory peer caps, accepted as a deviation and tracked as F-WORKTREE-4,
  not silently. PR #170 merged 2026-08-12 (`5b060a2`), settling the guard and
  docsync sources the audit reads.
- Batch 21 WP status: WP-0 and WP-1 done. WP-2 through WP-8 not yet started.
- **Perf note:** heatmap fetch speed is rate-limit bound; measurement and
  rationale live in FINDINGS.md F-B18-11 (single source).
- **Last.timer note (checked 2026-05-19):** the referenced project uses
  aggregate `user.gettopartists`/`user.gettoptracks` calls with page fan-out,
  not exact per-scrobble recent-track timestamps. Useful for future perf
  research, but not a drop-in heatmap speedup. See FINDINGS.md F-B19-3.
- Future feature candidates (confirmed by owner roadmap):
  - **Top songs** (future): rank most-played tracks for a year (Last.fm + possibly
    Spotify enrichment, separate background task + loading/results flow).

## 4. Execution log (for agent handoff)

Keep only the active window here: current batch entries plus the latest 4
non-current operational logs. Older dated entries live in
`docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.

**How to read dated entries:**
- Each heading `YYYY-MM-DD - ...` is a completion/addendum log.
- Untagged side-task history: `docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Tagged batch history: per-batch logs under `docs/history/logs/`.
- Batch scope/acceptance criteria: definitions under `docs/history/definitions/`.
- Current-batch boundaries are machine-managed (do not move entries manually):
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->`
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->`
- After any edit here, run `python scripts/doc_state_sync.py --fix`.
- Archive search: `rg -n "^### 20" docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->

### 2026-07-24 - Batch 21 opened: UI overhaul definition committed (Batch 21 WP-0)

- Scope: opened Batch 21 (UI overhaul -- Tailwind + daisyUI migration)
  on `wip/batch-21`, a worktree off `main` at the PR #162 merge.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` expanded from the stub into the full 9-WP
    definition derived from the owner's Claude Design audit (UI Audit
    v3): toolchain (WP-1), base shell + error-page pilot (WP-2), index
    (WP-3), unified loading (WP-4), results leaderboard (WP-5), heatmap
    seam removal (WP-6), unmatched + reason_code backend fix (WP-7),
    sweep + close-out (WP-8). Strangler migration, page by page.
  - Four owner decisions locked in the definition: rotating loading
    messages cut; welcome modal deleted; `limit_results` kept inside the
    thresholds disclosure; fonts self-hosted under `static/fonts/`.
  - Agent verification recorded in the definition: the unmatched
    reason-string grouping bug is live; `--bs-primary` never overridden;
    `bootstrap.Popover` in `index.js` is a third Bootstrap JS consumer
    the audit missed; `--bars-color` must be aliased in both themes.
  - PLAYBOOK Section 2 row title updated; Section 3 marks Batch 21
    active with next action WP-1; SESSION_CONTEXT rows updated.
  - Toolchain mechanics locked after an owner-relayed Opus 5 review:
    CLI binary in gitignored `scripts/bin/` with `.gitkeep`; auto-fetch
    at a pinned version via a new `scripts/dev/tailwind_build.py` (not
    `dev_start.py` -- app startup never needs the toolchain); WP-8 adds
    a rebuild-and-diff pre-commit hook for compiled-CSS drift; WP-8
    owner E2E explicitly opens the downloaded save-as-image file.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0 (expected
  root warning for the now-active `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md`).
- Forward guidance: WP-1 sets up the Tailwind v4 standalone CLI +
  daisyUI v5 bundled plugin, defines both themes from the audit token
  sheet, and commits the compiled CSS. No template changes until WP-2.

### 2026-08-20 - F-SWE-2 UTC album-year window fixed (Batch 21 WP-0)

- Scope: cleared the only F-SWE-1 migration blocker in the standalone
  prerequisite after WP-0 and before WP-1. No Tailwind or WP-1 work started.
- Plan vs implementation: as planned. `orchestrator.py` now imports
  `timezone` and passes `tzinfo=timezone.utc` to both listening-year boundary
  constructors. The regression drives the public `fetch_top_albums_async`
  workflow, simulates UTC-5 semantics only for naive constructors, and checks
  the literal UTC epoch values sent to the mocked Last.fm boundary. Existing
  mock track fixtures now construct their UTS values in explicit UTC too.
- TDD red evidence: before the production fix,
  `pytest -q tests/services/test_lastfm_logic.py::test_fetch_top_albums_uses_utc_year_window_on_non_utc_host`
  failed twice with the same boundary shift:

  ```text
  AssertionError: expected await not found.
  Expected: mock('testuser', 1704067200, 1735689599, progress_cb=None)
    Actual: mock('testuser', 1704085200, 1735707599, progress_cb=None)
  ```

  After the fix, the targeted test passed, and the complete test module passed
  with 8 tests.
- Deviations: no implementation deviation. Pre-push whole-file review corrected
  the README test badge and module inventory plus two forward-looking WP-7
  claims that still described WP-7 as the first test-count change. The same-day
  docsync source order gives live side-task entries precedence over
  current-batch entries, so the document-map entry below carries a later-count
  addendum that points back to this entry. Its original 590-test completion
  result stays unchanged.
  F-SWE-3 remains P2, F-B21-1 remains P1 without blocking WP-1, and root
  hygiene remains deferred until after WP-1.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **591 passed**, 3 warnings.
  `pre-commit run --all-files` -- all hooks pass; all tracked Markdown hashes
  match before and after the hook. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0 with
  the expected active-root `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` warning.
- Forward guidance: F-SWE-2 is resolved. WP-1 is next; pause for owner review
  of this commit before starting it.

### 2026-08-20 - PR #172 frontend-gate contract made executable (Batch 21 WP-0)

- Scope: addressed the two actionable P1 review threads on the active Batch 21
  definition before WP-1. This is design and state documentation only; no
  frontend runtime or WP-1 work started.
- Verification of the review findings: criterion 9 required the frontend gate
  at every WP while the validation section created it at WP-2, making WP-1
  impossible to complete. The planned Python script also had no declared
  Playwright package, browser provisioning, CI setup, or callable bridge to
  the machine-local MCP providers.
- Plan vs implementation: owner-approved as designed. The three existing
  repository gates remain mandatory at every WP and the frontend gate starts
  at WP-2. That WP pins `playwright==1.62.0` in `requirements-dev.txt`, installs
  its matching Chromium build explicitly on the developer machine and Linux
  CI, runs the repository gate in the Quality Gate, and documents setup in
  README and DEVELOPMENT when the runtime lands. The script owns an ephemeral
  loopback Flask server and always tears it down; missing tooling fails with an
  actionable command rather than downloading silently. No Node project,
  pytest plugin, or MCP dependency is introduced.
- Review disposition outside this commit: the nuanced F-SWE-3 thread received
  the owner-approved ROI explanation and was resolved without expanding WP-7.
  F-SWE-3 remains open at P2; operational Spotify failures do not become an
  unmatched-page `reason_code`.
- Deviations: none. The active definition is the canonical design document, so
  no duplicate `docs/superpowers/specs/` file was created.
- Validation: qualified `pytest -q` -- **591 passed**, 3 warnings; all
  pre-commit hooks passed; tracked-Markdown MD5 manifests were identical
  before and after the hook run; `doc_state_sync.py --check` passed with only
  the expected active-batch root-definition warning.
- Forward guidance: land PR #172, then start WP-1. The Playwright dependency,
  browser download, workflow change, gate implementation, tests, README, and
  DEVELOPMENT updates all land together at WP-2.

### 2026-08-20 - Tailwind and daisyUI toolchain completed (Batch 21 WP-1)

- Scope: added the Node-free pinned Tailwind/daisyUI toolchain, themes,
  committed compiled CSS, and Linux CI rebuild. No templates changed and
  `scripts/dev/dev_start.py` remains unchanged.
- Plan vs implementation: Tailwind v4.3.3 and daisyUI v5.7.19 pin seven
  platform assets -- Windows x64, macOS x64 and arm64, Linux x64 and arm64
  for glibc and musl -- plus `daisyui.mjs` and `daisyui-theme.mjs`. Every
  artifact is SHA-256-verified on every use; one verified atomic replacement
  follows an invalid cache entry. The source restricts daisyUI to button,
  card, modal, toggle, input, select, tab, toast, and alert; it locks the
  reviewed light/dark palette, type scale, 4px spacing ladder, 8/14/999px
  radii, and both `--bars-color` aliases. CI caches `scripts/bin/` by runner
  OS, architecture, and build-script hash.
- TDD evidence: initial collection failed for the missing
  `scripts.dev.tailwind_build` module; cache tests first failed on the absent
  cache interface; source-contract tests first failed on absent
  `static/css/tailwind.src.css`. Focused green commands were
  `pytest tests/scripts/dev/test_tailwind_build.py -q`,
  `pytest tests/scripts/dev/test_tailwind_build_cli.py -q`, and
  `pytest tests/scripts/dev/test_tailwind_build.py tests/scripts/dev/test_tailwind_build_cli.py -q`
  (35 passed).
- Reproducibility: Windows and the `python:3.13-slim` headless glibc-Linux
  probe both produced SHA-256
  `481230ebf858f2fe3b0497c7247be3532917e1c6432cd2bde0940721e81d1b09`.
  The Quality Gate is configured to rebuild with the same Linux x64 asset.
  It has not run yet, because the branch is unpushed.
- Documentation: DEVELOPMENT owns commands; README links rather than copying;
  BATCH21_DEFINITION owns the CI decision; exact pins and digests live in code.
- Deviations: owner-approved fail-closed hardening distinguishes only `None`
  as omitted, so explicit empty platform values cannot probe the live host,
  with deterministic `required_artifacts()` matrix coverage. Same-date
  live-side precedence also required this minimal pointer addendum and the
  deterministic rotation of one older non-current entry; point-in-time history
  was not rewritten. For the four final-review peer-size findings, the owner
  ruled that the cap is flexible when it prevents only files that are
  tremendously out of place or becoming god-files. The plan remains one
  reviewed execution contract, generated `tailwind.css` is indivisible, the
  builder owns one cohesive standard-library toolchain responsibility, and its
  tests stay beside that public seam. None is a god-file or out of place, so
  no split was made and `AGENTS.md` remains unchanged. Final review also
  found both musl pins unreachable: `platform.libc_ver()` reports nothing on
  musl and `libc` on some glibc hosts, so the plan's direct
  `platform.libc_ver()[0]` check gave way to `_normalize_libc()` and
  `_detect_libc()`, which probes for the musl loader. Verified in Docker on
  `python:3.13-alpine` and `python:3.13-slim`. The plan keeps its original
  code listing as the reviewed design.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **633 passed**, 3 warnings. All pre-commit hooks
  passed; tracked-Markdown manifests were identical before and after the hook;
  `doc_state_sync.py --fix` exited 0 with the expected active root-definition
  warning for `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md`.
- Forward guidance: owner review first; the root-hygiene side task is next;
  WP-2 follows it. WP-2 keeps the cache, removes the direct CI build step only
  when its drift hook lands, and adds the first Tailwind-consuming template.

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->

### 2026-08-22 - Tailwind citations renamed after the rescope (side-task)

- Scope: 13 line citations in `FINDINGS.md` and
  `docs/design/RECONCILIATION.md`. No code changed.
- Codex caught this on PR #173. It is correct.
- The `source(none)` comment moved `tailwind.src.css` down five lines. The
  rescope cut `tailwind.css` from 2,289 lines to 1,576. Every citation into
  either file broke at once. `:root:not([data-theme])` moved from 2042
  to 1335.
- The citations now name the block or the declaration: the two
  `@plugin "daisyui-theme.mjs"` blocks, `--spacing-*`, `--radius-*`,
  `--font-sans`, `--font-mono`, `--font-weight-medium`,
  `@custom-variant dark`, `prefersdark: true`. Named anchors do not drift.
- Checked the citations Codex did not flag. `heatmap.js:14-22`,
  `heatmap.js:25-26`, `theme.js:17`, `base.html:26` and `index.css:158` all
  still resolve. Those files did not change.
- This is `F-STYLE-1` happening again. The rule already exists for
  `AGENTS.md`. It applies to every file. Cite a name, not a number.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **633 passed**. `doc_state_sync.py --check`
  exits 0. `pre-commit run --all-files` passes.
- Next: **WP-2**.

### 2026-08-22 - Open findings mirrored to GitHub issues (side-task)

- Scope: created issues #174-#215. Rephrased two rules in `AGENTS.md`. Filed
  `F-B21-9`. No code changed.
- Why: Codex raised `F-B21-7` on PR #173 although the PR body listed it.
  Reviewers do not read `FINDINGS.md`. Issues are cheaper to search.
- 42 open findings are now mirrored: 28 P1, 10 P2, 3 Info, 1 Feature. Seven
  resolved findings were skipped. Labels are `finding` plus the severity.
- Each issue body says `FINDINGS.md` is the source of truth and that the
  issue is a read-only mirror. Nothing writes back to the file.
- `AGENTS.md` changes are rephrases, not additions. Bootstrap item 7 already
  said "read on demand"; it now names the three reasons to open the file and
  says a recorded defect is known and owned. The Markdown log-entry bullet
  now also asks for plain English. No new rule was added.
- `F-B21-9` records the gap. The mirror is manual and will drift. The owner
  accepted that on 2026-08-22 and asked for it to be written down rather
  than built now. A sync script is code and needs its own work package.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **633 passed**. `doc_state_sync.py --check`
  exits 0. `pre-commit run --all-files` passes.
- Next: **WP-2**.

### 2026-08-22 - PR #173 review answered, two import defects fixed (side-task)

- Scope: moved `docs/design/styles.css`. Fixed one claim in
  `docs/design/RECONCILIATION.md`. No code changed.
- Codex raised four threads. All four are correct. Claude disputed none.
- `styles.css` went into `docs/design/tokens/`. It belongs one level up.
  The file imports `tokens/fonts.css`. From inside `tokens/` that path does
  not exist. So the entry point loaded no tokens.
- The source project keeps `styles.css` at its root. `DesignSync list_files`
  confirms this. `git mv` fixes the path. The content does not change.
- `RECONCILIATION.md` said every colour in the README tables matches the
  theme. That is wrong. Three tokens match: `--surface-page`, `--text-strong`
  and `--accent`. Four are absent. Dark `--surface-sunken` is `#181520`, not
  `#1a1622`. The status colours are still Bootstrap's.
- A per-token table now replaces the claim.
- This is the second false claim of this shape in that file. `F-B21-8`
  records the first. Both came from a spot check.
- The other two threads repeat `F-B21-7`. Codex found them on its own. They
  stay with WP-2. WP-2 owns that code next.
- Checked this pass: only `RECONCILIATION.md` changed under `docs/design/`.
  The imported files match `fa56cd6`. Claude's Markdown has no non-ASCII.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **633 passed**. `doc_state_sync.py --check`
  exits 0. `pre-commit run --all-files` passes.
- Next: **WP-2**. It inherits `F-B21-7` and `F-B21-8`.

### 2026-08-22 - Tailwind source scope corrected after PR #173 went red (side-task)

- Scope: `static/css/tailwind.src.css` (one directive plus a comment), the
  regenerated `static/css/tailwind.css`, `FINDINGS.md` (`F-B21-8`), and the
  false claim in `docs/design/RECONCILIATION.md` section 2. Owner chose the
  fix and the recording from two options each.
- Trigger: PR #173's Quality Gate failed on "Verify committed Tailwind CSS".
  Not a flake. The rebuild added 30 lines the committed file did not have.
- Cause: `@source` **adds** to Tailwind v4's automatic detection instead of
  replacing it, so the whole repository was scanned, not just `templates/`
  and `static/js/`. The extractor turns bare words in Markdown into class
  candidates, so prose compiled into utilities -- `.contents`, `.isolate`,
  `.flex`, `.border`, `.relative`, `.sticky`, `.truncate`, `.italic`.
- The design import did not create this; it exposed it. The committed
  baseline was already contaminated. Scoping the scan removed **713 of 2,289
  lines, 31% of the stylesheet**.
- Fix: `@import "tailwindcss" source(none)`. Rejected alternatives, both
  offered to the owner: regenerate as-is, which would couple the design
  documentation to production CSS permanently; and `@source not "../../docs"`,
  which fixes only `docs/` and leaves `tests/`, `scripts/` and the root
  Markdown feeding the scanner.
- Verified rather than assumed: both theme blocks survive (`--color-base-100`
  is `#faf8f3` light and `#0e0c12` dark, and `data-theme` still appears three
  times), and a second consecutive build reproduces the first byte for byte.
- Deviations: two `@source not` directives are now unreachable and were left
  in place deliberately, as protection if `source(none)` is ever removed.
  Recorded in `F-B21-8`.
- **Process failure worth naming.** Last session's check,
  `git diff --exit-code -- static/css/tailwind.css`, was reported as proof
  that `docs/design/` was outside Tailwind's scope. It proves only that the
  file was not hand-edited. The build has to actually run. `F-B21-8` records
  that nothing local runs it, which is what WP-2's `tailwind-css-drift` hook
  closes.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **633 passed**, 3 warnings.
  `doc_state_sync.py --check` exits 0. `pre-commit run --all-files` passes.
  Quality Gate re-run on PR #173.
- Forward guidance: **WP-2 is next** and should treat `F-B21-7` and `F-B21-8`
  as its own, since the drift hook it adds runs both code paths.
