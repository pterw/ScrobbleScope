# ScrobbleScope Execution Playbook

Date: 2026-02-22
Purpose: Single source of truth for work sequencing and execution history.
Rules for agent behaviour live in `AGENTS.md`; current-state snapshot in
`.claude/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. Why this document exists

- Provide a single source of truth for work sequencing.
- Enable continuation by another agent with minimal context loss.
- Prevent risky refactor-first changes before parity tests exist.

**Implementation principles:**
1. Approval tests before structural refactor.
2. No behavior-breaking refactors without parity checks.
3. Add observability before optimization where possible.
4. Keep changes batch-scoped and reversible.
5. Keep security-safe rendering (`tojson`, escaping) as baseline.

A batch's close-out entry sits in its per-batch log only when the heading
carried a `(Batch N WP-X)` tag (as Batch 18's did). Close-outs tagged
`(Batch N close-out)` are not parser-recognized and were routed to the
monolith archive instead -- Batches 19 and 20 are the current examples.
See FINDINGS F-DOCSYNC-3.

### Open decisions (owner confirmation needed)

1. Persistent store choice: Postgres only or Postgres + Redis.
2. Retry UX policy: immediate retry button only, or retry + cooldown messaging.
3. Error copy style and user-facing tone for upstream failures.

## 3. Active batch + next action

- **Batch 18 is complete.** All 5 WPs done. Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH18_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 19 is complete.** All 5 WPs done plus owner-review follow-up.
  Definition archived: `docs/history/definitions/BATCH19_DEFINITION.md`.
  PR #152 (Batches 18 + 19) merged to `main`.
- **Batch 20 is complete.** All 9 WPs done (WP-0 through WP-5 via PR #159
  on `file-hygeine`; audit gap-fix follow-up, WP-6, WP-7, and WP-8 on
  `wip/batch-20`, submitted as PR #162). Definition archived:
  `docs/history/definitions/BATCH20_DEFINITION.md`.
- **Batch 21 is active.** Definition: `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` (repo
  root). Scope: UI overhaul -- Bootstrap 5.1.3 -> Tailwind v4 (standalone
  CLI) + daisyUI v5, warm heatmap-derived themes propagated app-wide,
  page-by-page strangler migration. Expanded from the owner's Claude
  Design audit (UI Audit v3); four owner decisions locked in the
  definition. Branch: `wip/batch-21` (worktree off `main`).
- **Next action:** execute the full F-SWE-1 principles audit, then proceed to
  Batch 21 WP-1. PR #169 merged to `main` on 2026-08-08 and the Quality Gate
  is green for `5bc6294`, so the canonical repository-integrity gate and
  read-only worktree guard are shipped and
  F-DOCSYNC-5/F-WORKTREE-1/F-WORKTREE-2 are resolved. Three guard files
  exceed their directory peer caps after review remediation -- accepted as a
  deviation and tracked as F-WORKTREE-4 in FINDINGS.md, not silently. Review
  remediation ran to round 6: rounds 2 through 5 landed before the merge, and
  round 6 was reviewed after the final push, so its four findings reached
  `main` unaddressed. They are remediated in **PR #170** (open, on
  `wip/batch-21`), which must land before the F-SWE-1 audit begins -- the
  audit reads the guard and docsync sources that PR still changes.
- Batch 21 WP status: WP-0 done. WP-1 through WP-8 not yet started.
- **Perf note:** heatmap fetch speed is rate-limit bound; measurement and
  rationale live in FINDINGS.md F-B18-11 (single source).
- **Last.timer note (checked 2026-05-19):** the referenced project uses
  aggregate `user.gettopartists`/`user.gettoptracks` calls with page fan-out,
  not exact per-scrobble recent-track timestamps. Useful for future perf
  research, but not a drop-in heatmap speedup. See FINDINGS.md F-B19-3.
- Future feature candidates (confirmed by owner roadmap):
  - **Top songs** (future): rank most-played tracks for a year (Last.fm + possibly
    Spotify enrichment, separate background task + loading/results flow).

## 4. Execution log (for agent handoff)

Keep only the active window here: current batch entries plus the latest 4
non-current operational logs. Older dated entries live in
`docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.

**How to read dated entries:**
- Each heading `YYYY-MM-DD - ...` is a completion/addendum log.
- Untagged side-task history: `docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Tagged batch history: per-batch logs under `docs/history/logs/`.
- Batch scope/acceptance criteria: definitions under `docs/history/definitions/`.
- Current-batch boundaries are machine-managed (do not move entries manually):
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->`
  - `<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-END -->`
- After any edit here, run `python scripts/doc_state_sync.py --fix`.
- Archive search: `rg -n "^### 20" docs/logarchive/PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`

<!-- DOCSYNC:CURRENT-BATCH-START -->

### 2026-07-24 - Batch 21 opened: UI overhaul definition committed (Batch 21 WP-0)

- Scope: opened Batch 21 (UI overhaul -- Tailwind + daisyUI migration)
  on `wip/batch-21`, a worktree off `main` at the PR #162 merge.
- Plan vs implementation:
  - `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md` expanded from the stub into the full 9-WP
    definition derived from the owner's Claude Design audit (UI Audit
    v3): toolchain (WP-1), base shell + error-page pilot (WP-2), index
    (WP-3), unified loading (WP-4), results leaderboard (WP-5), heatmap
    seam removal (WP-6), unmatched + reason_code backend fix (WP-7),
    sweep + close-out (WP-8). Strangler migration, page by page.
  - Four owner decisions locked in the definition: rotating loading
    messages cut; welcome modal deleted; `limit_results` kept inside the
    thresholds disclosure; fonts self-hosted under `static/fonts/`.
  - Agent verification recorded in the definition: the unmatched
    reason-string grouping bug is live; `--bs-primary` never overridden;
    `bootstrap.Popover` in `index.js` is a third Bootstrap JS consumer
    the audit missed; `--bars-color` must be aliased in both themes.
  - PLAYBOOK Section 2 row title updated; Section 3 marks Batch 21
    active with next action WP-1; SESSION_CONTEXT rows updated.
  - Toolchain mechanics locked after an owner-relayed Opus 5 review:
    CLI binary in gitignored `scripts/bin/` with `.gitkeep`; auto-fetch
    at a pinned version via a new `scripts/dev/tailwind_build.py` (not
    `dev_start.py` -- app startup never needs the toolchain); WP-8 adds
    a rebuild-and-diff pre-commit hook for compiled-CSS drift; WP-8
    owner E2E explicitly opens the downloaded save-as-image file.
- Deviations: none.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **390 passed**. `pre-commit run --all-files`
  -- all hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0 (expected
  root warning for the now-active `BATCH21_DEFINITION.md`).
- Forward guidance: WP-1 sets up the Tailwind v4 standalone CLI +
  daisyUI v5 bundled plugin, defines both themes from the audit token
  sheet, and commits the compiled CSS. No template changes until WP-2.

### 2026-08-11 - PR #170 round 1; the forgery class was wider than the line break (side-task)

- Scope: three findings from two independent reviewers on the open PR -- two
  from Copilot review `4902230481`, raised against the current head rather
  than an earlier one, and one from Codex (`r3754609766`). All three were
  reproduced before any code changed, and all three were valid.
- The fix shipped earlier the same day was incomplete. Excluding CR and LF
  stopped a forged *second line*, but WT003 renders the captured value into a
  terminal, and an escape sequence repaints the existing line without ever
  needing one: `ESC[2J ESC[H` clears the screen and redraws a clean verdict.
  DEL erases what was already written, and padding spaces push a fake result
  across the visible line. Reproduced directly: the previous pattern returned
  an `expected_branch` still carrying a raw `\x1b`. The commit message claimed
  PLAYBOOK prose could no longer forge guard output, and that claim was
  broader than the fix behind it.
- Plan vs implementation: rather than enumerate control characters, the value
  is now restricted to what Git actually permits in a ref name -- no control
  characters, no DEL or C1 range, no spaces. That subsumes the line-break case
  instead of sitting beside it, and every rejection still fails closed to
  WT002. Verified against all four documented Section 3 branch styles and the
  live PLAYBOOK, so the narrowing costs no legitimate form.
- The second finding was a test-quality defect in the same commit. The three
  parametrized line endings were near-duplicates: `parse_batch_branch` splits
  and rejoins the section, so LF, CRLF, and CR arrive at the pattern already
  normalized to LF, and deleting `\r` from the pattern left all three green.
  That is the prohibited near-duplicate pattern, shipped in the very change
  that added an adversarial test. Replaced with one parser-level line-break
  case plus three cases that survive normalization.
- The third finding was a blast-radius miss in the previous commit, and the
  more instructive one. Step 3 of the guard implementation plan still
  prescribed the original `[^`]+` value class as a normative instruction, so
  the plan remained a working recipe for rebuilding the vulnerability the
  production fix had just closed. The earlier commit had edited that same
  plan file -- for the `debug` parameter -- without sweeping it for the
  pattern actually being changed. The snippet now carries the shipped class
  plus a note saying why it must not be relaxed, so the reason travels with
  the instruction rather than living only in production code.
- Deviations: the first attempt at the DEL case did not isolate what it
  claimed. Its payload also contained spaces, so the space rule blocked it and
  a mutant permitting DEL still passed. Found by running a mutation matrix
  over the exclusion ranges rather than by rereading the test, and corrected
  by removing the spaces from that payload. Recorded because it is the same
  defect class the finding reported, reintroduced while fixing it.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **576 passed** with the 3 existing aiohttp/Python
  3.13 warnings. All 10 pre-commit hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` --
  exit 0 with the expected root-BATCH warning. Each new case was
  mutation-checked: permitting the space boundary leaks only the padding case,
  permitting the DEL/C1 range leaks only the DEL case, and the previously
  shipped pattern leaks all three non-newline cases. The retained line-break
  case adds no unique range coverage and is kept only as the single
  parser-level case the review asked for.
- Forward guidance: land PR #170, then F-SWE-1, then Batch 21 WP-1. The
  lesson generalizes the one recorded below: a fix aimed at the reported
  instance rather than the class leaves the class open, and here the reported
  instance was a line break while the class was anything a terminal
  interprets.

### 2026-08-11 - PR #169 round 6 landed after the merge; the guard could be made to lie (side-task)

- Scope: four findings from Copilot review `4877974867`'s successor,
  `4888134055`. The review was submitted 2026-08-08 04:38 UTC against head
  `6ed9d7c`; the PR merged at 07:57 UTC with no commit in between. All four
  were re-verified as still live on `main` before any work started -- the
  merged head is tree-identical to `main`, so nothing had superseded them.
- Why one of them mattered more than its "suppressed" label suggested:
  `BRANCH_RE` captured `[^`]+`, a negated class that matches newlines, while
  Section 3 is parsed as one newline-joined block. A backticked Branch value
  spanning lines was therefore captured whole, and WT003 prints that value
  verbatim. Ordinary PLAYBOOK prose could forge a second diagnostic line in
  the guard's own output -- the output the design document says a less
  capable agent can stop safely on, knowing only the exit status and the
  remediation text. Reproduced before fixing, for all three line endings.
- Plan vs implementation: the label and value are now pinned to one line
  (`[ \t]*` for the separator, `[^`\r\n]+` for the value). A rejected value
  leaves no branch to resolve, which `classify_lineage` already reports as
  WT002 -- so the fix fails closed rather than silently skipping the branch
  comparison. That mattered to the choice: making malformed metadata mean
  "no branch declared" would have repeated round 4's defect, where an
  ambiguous state switched a check off instead of blocking on it.
- The other three were documentation currency: the `inspect_worktree`
  interface in the guard plan omitted the shipped keyword-only `debug`
  parameter, and SESSION_CONTEXT and FINDINGS both carried a
  `Last updated: 2026-08-06` that predated their own 2026-08-07 content.
  PLAYBOOK Section 3 was additionally stale on its own terms: it still
  directed the reader to merge PR #169, three days after the merge, and
  carried a pre-merge caveat about a missing Quality Gate run that now
  exists and is green for `5bc6294`.
- Deviations, recorded rather than taken silently:
  - **`wip/batch-21` was realigned with an owner-authorized force-push.**
    It sat 39 ahead / 39 behind `origin/main` with an identical tree -- the
    WT004 rebase-merge artifact this guard was built to catch, and the first
    live instance of it. `git cherry` confirmed zero commits without an
    equivalent patch on `main`, so the reset was lossless. Done before any
    work so the Pre-Work Checklist could pass honestly rather than be waived.
  - The session ran in a linked worktree under `.claude/worktrees/`, already
    covered by the `.claude/*` ignore rule, reusing the primary checkout's
    sole `.venv` through the qualified paths the guard printed. This is the
    first live exercise of the F-WORKTREE-2 path: the guard reported WT000
    and resolved all three tools from the primary checkout.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **575 passed** with the 3 existing
  aiohttp/Python 3.13 warnings (572 before; the three new cases are the
  line-ending variants). All 10 pre-commit hooks pass.
  `doc_state_sync.py --check` -- exit 0 with the expected root-BATCH warning.
  Mutation-checked: the new test was watched failing on all three variants
  before the pattern was narrowed, and the existing bold-label and
  prose-tolerance cases still pass, so the pattern was not over-narrowed.
- Submitted as PR #170 against `main` after owner instruction to push and
  open one. Both Quality Gate triggers fired on the new head, `push` and
  `pull_request` -- the dropped-dispatch gap recorded against `8463ca4` did
  not recur.
- Forward guidance: land PR #170, then F-SWE-1, then Batch 21 WP-1. The
  process lesson is narrower than round 5's: a review that arrives between
  the final push and the merge button has no round of its own, so nothing
  swept it. Check for a review newer than the last commit before merging.

### 2026-08-07 - PR #169 round 5; contradicting a claim is itself a change (side-task)

- Scope: five suppressed findings, all valid, all self-inflicted. Four were
  caused by round 4 recording F-WORKTREE-4 without sweeping for the claims
  that finding contradicts; the fifth by round 4 repointing a resolver name at
  one site while an identical literal sat 300 lines earlier in the same file.
- Root cause, and the reason it recurs: the pre-push sweep had no pinned base,
  so each round swept only its own commits and inherited nothing. Round 2
  diagnosed this and fixed it by sweeping `git diff origin/main...HEAD`, but
  recorded the fix only in a dated log entry, which this repository treats as
  non-normative. Rounds 3 and 4 duly regressed. Both rules are now in the
  pre-push checklist rather than in a log entry: pin the sweep base to the
  branch, and treat recording a deviation as a change whose blast radius must
  be swept -- grepping the vocabulary of the property being deviated from, not
  the words of the new finding, which appear nowhere else.
- Plan vs implementation: five affirmative peer-cap claims repointed across
  the plan, the spec, and FINDINGS; the DOC003 description corrected to
  describe the check that shipped rather than a bare regex the implementation
  deliberately avoids; the interface inventory repointed to the authority API.
- Deviations, logged rather than silently taken:
  - **Round 3 shipped without a Section 4 entry.** Commits `14b3eac` and
    `1c783a9` carried no dated log entry, breaching the missing-log-entries
    anti-pattern in the very PR that ships a documentation-integrity gate.
    Recorded here retroactively rather than back-dated: round 3 fixed seven
    findings across the plan, the spec, AGENTS, and FINDINGS, and narrowed
    F-WORKTREE-3 after re-verifying its remaining clauses.
  - `_latest_test_count_from_entries` is left in place though no production
    caller remains, because deleting it rewrites eight test call sites --
    a refactor, not a review fix. Tracked as F-DOCSYNC-7.
- Peer-agent correction: a concurrent session had staged a partial fix that
  introduced two new false statements -- a docstring naming `_build_candidates`,
  which exists nowhere in the repository, and an attribution of the
  `_cross_validate` removal to round 2 when `a3c923f` did it in round 1. Both
  corrected here. Worth recording because it is the same defect class the
  round was fixing, produced independently by a different writer.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **572 passed** with 3 existing aiohttp/Python
  3.13 warnings. All 10 pre-commit hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` --
  exit 0 with the expected root-BATCH warning.
- Forward guidance: merge. Round 5 was entirely documentation currency, and
  the remaining backlog is scoped as a hygiene batch rather than another round.

### 2026-08-07 - PR #169 round 4; the integrity gate could be switched off (side-task)

- Scope: eight findings from review round 4 -- one visible, seven suppressed.
  Six valid and fixed, one declined as an accepted deviation, one refuted.
- The material defect was self-inflicted by round 2. Making ambiguity an
  explicit state fixed the renderer but left `None` meaning two things at the
  integrity boundary, and DOC006 skips its comparison on `None`. Reproduced
  before fixing: with an unambiguous authority a stale dashboard value raises
  DOC006; with an ambiguous newest entry the same stale value passes and the
  gate exits 0. Writing one ambiguous log entry therefore disabled the check
  that exists to catch exactly that state.
- Plan vs implementation: the resolver now returns `TestCountAuthority`
  (count plus whether the newest entry was ambiguous) so the reason travels
  with the value instead of each consumer re-deriving it. DOC006 treats an
  ambiguous authority beside a named numeric field as blocking. Its
  remediation no longer names PLAYBOOK unconditionally, because the authority
  may be a rotated archive entry, and says to record an unambiguous result
  when there is no number to agree with. The status block distinguishes "no
  bold count" from "several counts without a `pytest -q` result", which sends
  the reader to the entry that caused it rather than to a missing number.
- Deliberate non-action: three guard files now exceed their directory peer
  caps (256/236 for the collector, 270/184 and 192/184 for two guard test
  modules). All were compliant before the review rounds and crossed while
  fixing confirmed defects. Splitting them was declined -- the rule prevents
  unmaintainable monoliths and none of these approaches that -- and recorded
  as F-WORKTREE-4 rather than left implicit, since Section 3 had described
  the guard as peer-sized and that had stopped being true.
- Refuted: the review claimed the SESSION_CONTEXT per-file table sums to 573
  against a stated 568. It sums to 568 across 35 rows, verified two ways and
  reconciled row-by-row against `pytest --collect-only` with no drift. First
  incorrect finding in four rounds; the others were all valid.
- Validation: `pytest -q` -- **572 passed** with 3 existing aiohttp/Python
  3.13 warnings. All 10 pre-commit hooks pass. `doc_state_sync.py --check` --
  exit 0 with the expected root-BATCH warning. Both new behaviours were
  mutation-checked: neutralizing the ambiguity branch in the gate and in the
  renderer each fails its own regression.
- Forward guidance: merge. Four rounds in, the findings are now generated by
  the previous round's fixes rather than by the original work, and this round
  produced the first refuted item -- both are diminishing-returns signals.
